_**Prerequisite:** understand the environment concept offered by [Delivery Configs](/guides/user/managed-delivery/delivery-configs/#environments)_

## What is an Environment Constraint?

Environment constraints control how an artifact version flows through environments. A constraint can
be as simple as ensuring an artifact isn't promoted into `Environment B` unless it has successfully deployed into
`Environment A`. Constraints can also specify that an artifact needs to have a canary evaluated by Kayenta before
it can be deployed into an environment, while also defining how the canary should be deployed and evaluated.

## Defining Constraints

Every environment defined in a Delivery Config supports a top-level `constraints` list property. 

The following example ensures that artifact versions are only promoted into the `staging` environment after
successful deployment to the `test` environment, and only if the current time is within the days Monday thru 
Thursday and the hours of 8am and 4pm.

```yaml
environments:
- name: staging
  resources: # omitted for brevity
  notifications: # omitted for brevity
  constraints: 
  - type: depends-on
    environment: testing
  - type: allowed-times
    windows:
    - days: Monday-Thursday
      hours: 8-16
```

## Constraint Types and Ordering

Constraints are currently bucketed into stateless and stateful types. Stateless constraints can always be fully
evaluated in a single pass and do not interact with users or external systems. The current stateless constraint
types are `depends-on` and `allowed-times`.

Stateless constraints are always evaluated first, and must be satisfied before any stateful constraints are
evaluated. Stateful constraints are a powerful construct, with the ability to mutate cloud state during their 
evaluation. Examples include deploying a new artifact version into an environment for the sake of canary
analysis, or launching a smoke-test pipeline against a prior environment, gating promotion on its success.

This implicit ordering by type ensures that a pipeline constraint gating promotion to a production environment
on smoke-tests run against a prior environment will only invoke the test pipeline after the artifact version
under evaluation is deployed to the prior environment. 

All stateful constraints can be manually overridden, such as when a canary failure is deemed to be expected 
for a given change, or a false alarm. When an environment defines multiple constraints, all must pass before a 
new artifact is promoted into the environment.
 
## Available Constraints

### Depends On

The `depends-on` constraint ensures that an artifact version will not deploy into the environment it is
attached to, unless it has successfully deployed into the dependent environment.

**Parameters**
`environment`: The name of the dependent environment. It must be defined within the same delivery config as
the target environment containing the constraint.

**Example**

```yaml
  constraints: 
  - type: depends-on
    environment: testing
```

### Allowed Times

The `allowed-times` constraints provides a time based gate on promotion into an environment. It can be used to
ensure promotion to an environment only occurs during business hours, or quiet times.

**Parameters**
`windows`: A list of time windows; multiple windows can be specified on a single constraint. The constraint is
satisfied if the current time matches any single window.
`tz`: *Optional* The timezone to evaluate the constraint in. This is optional, by default the timezone specified via
the `default.time-zone` spring configuration property is used, not the JVM or OS timezone. If your organization
operates in a single timezone, this property should likely be set that timezone.

**Window Parameters**
`hours`: Supports ranges (i.e. `10-20`) and comma separated lists (i.e. `5,6,7,8`) or a combination
of the two.
`days`: Supports aliases (`weekdays` and `weekends`), as well as ranges and comma separated lists of
days in their java standard (`java.util.Calendar`) short (`mon-thu`) or full (`monday-thursday`) names.

**Example**
```yaml
  constraints:
  - type: allowed-times
    windows:
      - days: Monday-Wednesday,Friday
        hours: 8-16
      - days: Thursday
        hours: 14-16
```
This allows artifacts to deploy into the environment between 8am-4pm on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, and Friday or
between 2-4pm on Thursday.

### Manual Judgement

The `manual-judgement` constraint prevents an artifact from deploying to an environment without explicit
approval via an external API client. UI support for approving or rejecting judgements as well as an 
interactive slack bot are under development but direct use of Spinnaker's REST API is currently required to
answer a manual judgement. See [Interacting with and Overriding Constraints](#interacting-with-and-overriding-constraints)
for details.
 
**Parameters**

`timeout`: *(Optional)*; Type: `Duration`; Default Value: `PT1W`

If judgement is not provided within this time (starting when the constraint is initially evaluated for a 
given environment and artifact version), it is considered rejected.
 
**Example**
```yaml
  constraints:
  - type: manual-judgement
```

### Pipeline

The `pipeline` constraint launches a pipeline, optionally passing along constraint provided trigger
parameters. The pipeline execution is periodically monitored and the constraint status derived from
the final status of the execution. 

**Parameters**

`pipelineId`: Type: `String`

The configuration id of the pipeline to be executed during constraint evaluation. If unknown,
edit the given pipeline from the Spinnaker UI. From the edit configuration view, the `pipelineId` is the
final part of the URL. The pipeline can be a part of any application, but must be runnable via
the service account defined in the target environment's delivery config. 

`retries`: *(Optional)*; Type: `Integer`

If set, pipeline failures will be retried up-to this many times if pipeline
execution goes terminal for any reason. The constraint evaluation will fail once retries are exhausted.

`parameters`: *(Optional)*; Type: `Map<String, Object>` 

If set, the contents of this map are passed as trigger parameters when executing the pipeline. Expressions
are not currently supported.

`timeout`: *(Optional)*; Type: `Duration`; Default Value: `PT2H`

If the pipeline execution does not complete within this time, it is considered a failure.

**Example**
```yaml
  constraints:
  - type: pipeline
    pipelineId: fn0rd5d1-6217-4fcf-aa3d-ce7f59af9cac
    retries: 1
    parameters:
      foo: bar
```

### Canary

The `canary` constraint supports deploying experiment and control clusters across multiple regions within
the target environment. Experiment/control cluster health is evaluated via Kayenta and the clusters
removed once evaluation is complete. By default, a multi-region constraint must pass in all regions
for the constraint to pass but this behavior is configurable.

The `canary` constraint currently only supports EC2. Keel configuration properties may need to be set
depending on how Kayenta accesses time-series data and persists state.

**System Configuration Properties**

`defaults.constraint.canary.metrics-account`: *Default Value: atlas-global.prod* 

Unless your time series data is stored in Netflix Atlas, this should be set to the equivalent value used 
with the Orca Kayenta stage.

`defaults.constraint.canary.storage-account`: *Default Value: s3-objects* 

This should be set to the value of Kayenta's `default-storage-account`.

**Parameters**

`canaryConfigId`: Type: `String`

The configuration id of the canary rules used for evaluation. If unknown, select a specific
configuration from Spinnaker's Canary Config UI. The `canaryConfigId` is the final segment of the resulting url. 

`beginAnalysisAfter`: *(Optional)*; Type: `Duration`; Default Value: `PT10M`

After the deployment of canary clusters completes, Spinnaker will wait this amount of time before launching the 
first Kayenta analysis. This allows for the filtering or inclusion of service warmup behavior in the analysis. 

`canaryAnalysisInterval`: *(Optional)*; Type: `Duration`; Default Value: `PT30M`

After the completion of any `beginAnalysisAfter` delay, Kayenta analysis are launched at this recurring interval, 
until post-`beginAnalysisAfter` runtime exceeds the `lifetime` parameter.

`lifetime`: *(Optional)*; Type: `Duration`; Default Value: `PT30M`

Maximum runtime for the canary, exempting deployment times and any initial delay configured via `beginAnalysisAfter`.

`cleanupDelay`: *(Optional)*; Type: `Duration`; Default Value: `0`

When a canary fails due to a failing Kayenta score, Spinnaker will wait this amount of time before deleting canary 
clusters. Useful if engineers desire an opportunity to manually inspect instances involved in the failure.

`marginalScore`: Type: `Integer`

If Kayenta generates a canary score below the `marginalScore`, it is considered an immediate failure.

`passScore`: Type: `Integer`

If Kayenta generates a final canary score >= `passScore`, the constraint will pass.

`regions`: Type: `Set<String>` 

Each region will get its own independently deployed and analyzed control/experiment pair.

`capacity`: Type: `Integer`

Control and experiment clusters have their min/max/desired pinned to this value.

`source`: Type: `CanarySource`

Defined in yaml as a `Map<String, String>` with the following properties:
  * `account`
  * `cloudProvider`
  * `cluster`

This should refer to an active cluster in the target environment deployed in
all of the regions the constraint is configured to run canaries in. Control/experiment clusters are configured
based on the source cluster (i.e. account, subnet, instance type, firewall rules).

`minSuccessfulRegions`: *(Optional)*; Type: `Integer`; Default Value: `0`

If set to >0 on a multi-region canary, the constraint will pass if Kayenta analysis passes in this many regions. 
I.e. if set to 2 on a constraint that defines a 3-region canary, the failure of a single region is ignored.

`failureCancelsRunningRegions`: *(Optional)*; Type: `Boolean`; Default Value: `true`

If true, the failure of any region
that violates the `minSuccessfulRegions` parameter triggers the immediate cancellation of any canaries still
running in other regions. 

`metricsAccount`: *(Optional)*; Type: `String` 

If set, overrides the `defaults.constraint.canary.metrics-account` property. 
This may be required in environments with multiple TSD instances.

`storageAccount`: *(Optional)*; Type: `String`

If set, overrides the `defaults.constraint.canary.storage-account` property. Not typically required.

**Example**
```yaml
  constraints:
  - type: canary
    canaryConfigId: fn0rd5d1-6217-4fcf-aa3d-ce7f59af9cac
    beginAnalysisAfter: PT3M
    canaryAnalysisInterval: PT10M
    lifetime: PT90M
    marginalScore: 75
    passScore: 90
    capacity: 2
    source:
      account: appaccount
      cloudProvider: aws
      cluster: app-prod
    regions:
      - us-east-1
      - us-west-2
      - eu-west-1
    minSuccessfulRegions: 2
```

## Interacting with and Overriding Constraints

Apart from the [depends-on](#depends-on) constraint, all constraint types either expect interaction from a user 
(in the case of [manual-judgement](#manual-judgement)) or can have their automated judgements overruled by a
user. The following API endpoints are currently available to interact with constraints.

  String comment;
  Map<String, Object> attributes;
```

### Setting or Overriding Constraint State
