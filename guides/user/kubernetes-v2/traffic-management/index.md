This guide shows the basics of how to manage traffic during deployments using
the [Kubernetes provider](/setup/install/providers/kubernetes-v2). This includes
automatically attaching a
[Service](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/)
to a workload during deployment, and defining pipelines to perform blue/green
deployments.

## Attach a Service to a Workload

Kubernetes manages the relationship between
[Pods](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/pod/) and
[Services](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/)
using [Labels and
Selectors](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/labels/).
Spinnaker acknowledges this relationship with the blue load balancer icon
on a workload as shown here:

{%
  include
  figure
  image_path="./lb.png"
%}

You can also tell Spinnaker which Service objects a workload should be
associated with for its lifetime using the
[`traffic.spinnaker.io/load-balancers`](/reference/providers/kubernetes-v2/#traffic)
annotation. To try this out, do the following:

Deploy the following Service using the "Create Load Balancer" button:

```yaml
kind: Service
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: my-service
spec:
  selector:
    app: myapp
  ports:
  - protocol: TCP
    port: 80
```

{%
  include
  figure
  image_path="./create-lb.png"
%}

And then deploy the following Replica Set using the "Create Server Group"
button:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: ReplicaSet
metadata:
  name: frontend
  labels:
    tier: frontend
  annotations:
    traffic.spinnaker.io/load-balancers: '["service my-service"]' # <-- annotation
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      tier: frontend
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        tier: frontend
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: frontend
        image: gcr.io/google_samples/gb-frontend:v3
```

{%
  include
  figure
  image_path="create-sg.png"
%}

Notice that the selector `app: myapp` appearing on the Service did not have to
be specified on the Replica Set's PodSpec; Spinnaker adds this automatically.

### Caveats

There are a few caveats when using this annotation:

* The list of Services supplied in this annotation does _not_ need to specify
  all Services a workload may be attached to. If your workload's labels already
  attach it Service A, and you list Service B in the annotation, both Service A
  and B will route requests to this workload.

  You can think of this annotation as only supplying the list of _additional_
  services to attach to, not as an exhaustive list.

* If you use this annotation, Spinnaker will edit the workload's labels, either
  in the `metadata.labels`, or `spec.template.metadata.labels` sections. As a
  result, if the labels added to or removed from the
  `spec.template.metadata.labels` conflict with the label requirements in the
  object's `spec.selector.match[Labels/Expressions]` section, the deployment
  will fail.

* This annotation tells Spinnaker which service or services to make traffic
  changes to. For example, if you specify service "A" in the annotation of a
  manifest and subsequently disable it, only traffic from service "A" will be
  disabled, even if you receive traffic from both services "A" and "B".

## Route Traffic During a Deployment (Blue/Green)

Spinnaker supports dynamically enabling and disabling traffic to a particular
Kubernetes resource. This can be used in a pipeline to configure Blue/Green
rollouts, as shown below.

### You Must Use Replica Sets

Spinnaker manages traffic using labels, and has to edit them on running
resources. Given that edits to Deployment objects trigger rollouts, the only
way to carry out Blue/Green deployments without editing the Service object
directly is using Replica Sets, which are safely edited in-place by Spinnaker.
To be clear, these label edits are abstracted into higher-level "Enable" and
"Disable" stages to manage traffic, and are described below.

In turn, when a user submits a change to a Replica Set (either ad-hoc, or using
a pipeline) to update an image, configuration, etc... Spinnaker makes sure to
deploy a new Replica Set with a unique `-vNNN` suffix. This is in contrast with
the edits to labels Spinnaker performs _in place_ to manage traffic. The
interaction between edits to Replica Sets made by users and those made by
Spinnaker will be made clear in the below sample pipeline walkthrough.

### Sample Blue/Green Pipeline

We will create a pipeline with two stages: Deploy, and Disable. The goal is to
first deploy a new version of your application, have the stage wait until all
Pods' health checks pass, and then disable the prior version of your
application. When completed, an execution of this pipeline will look like:

{%
  include
  figure
  image_path="./run.png"
%}

#### Prerequisites

You need the following:

1. Spinnaker with the [Kubernetes provider](/setup/install/providers/kubernetes-v2) configured

2. One service called `my-service` running in the cluster and namespace your
   pipeline will deploy to. For the purpose of this example we will assume it
   has the following specification:

  ```yaml
  kind: Service
  apiVersion: v1
  metadata:
    name: my-service
  spec:
    selector:
      frontedBy: my-service # will be applied to backends by Spinnaker
    ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 80
  ```

#### Configure the Deploy Stage

Create a pipeline and add a "Deploy (Manifest)" stage, and configure the
following (text) manifest to deploy:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: ReplicaSet
metadata:
  annotations:
    strategy.spinnaker.io/max-version-history: '2'
    traffic.spinnaker.io/load-balancers: '["service my-service"]'
  labels:
    app: myapp
  name: myapp-frontend
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: myapp
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: myapp
    spec:
      containers:
        - image: 'gcr.io/google_samples/gb-frontend:v3'
          name: frontend
```

The stage configuration should look like this:

{%
  include
  figure
  image_path="./deploy-stage.png"
%}

There are _two_ important annotations to pay attention to here:

* `traffic.spinnaker.io/load-balancers`

  This annotation is explained [above](#attach-a-service-to-a-workload),
  and is used here to both indicate to Spinnaker which Service to attach during
  deployment time, and which Service to detach during the disable stage.

* `strategy.spinnaker.io/max-version-history`

  This annotation is explained [in the reference
  section](/reference/providers/kubernetes-v2/#strategy), and is used to ensure
  that no more than a certain number of versions of this Replica Set are
  running for garbage collection purposes.

#### Configure the Disable Stage

Add a "Disable (Manifest)" stage after the Deploy stage, and set the following
values:

| Field | Value | 
|-|-|
| __Namespace__ | `default` |
| __Kind__ | `replicaSet` |
| __Selector__ | `Choose a target dynamically` |
| __Cluster__ | `replicaSet frontend` |
| __Target__ | `Second Newest` |

The stage configuration should look like this:

{%
  include
  figure
  image_path="./disable.png"
%}

There are _two_ important fields here:

* __Selector__: `Choose a target dynamically`

  With every run of the pipeline a new Replica Set is created, and therefore we
  cannot know ahead of time which version of the Replica Set to disable. This
  field allows us to pick a Replica Set based on the __Target__ value.

* __Target__: `Second Newest`

  By picking the `Second Newest` target, we select the second newest Replica
  Set when this stage starts, or in other words, what was just previously
  serving traffic.

#### Run the Pipeline

After a few runs of the pipeline, you should see the following in your cluster
screen:
