You've [installed and set up Spinnaker](/setup/); now what?

<!--

* generalized statement of the fact that what you're gonna use Spinnaker for:
  - configure infrastructure for the services you're going to deploy
  - make pipelines to deploy those services
  - something about how there are other things you can do too, like ACA, but
     that this guides is only about the first, fundamental, things you're going
     to need to do.

* Note about inferred applications

  Because our context here is "I've just installed spinnaker, and now I don't
  know what I'm looking at (or what to do), we've got to mention that there
  might be some applications there already.

  - How did they get there if I didn't create anything?
  - What do I do with them?

* Create an application
And obviously link to the new applications guide

* Configure the application

* Configure your infrastructure for the application
Be  sure to note that this is done per application

* Create your first pipeline
Write a synopsis, then link to
* Best practices for...things?





Other things to do:

* Add link to end of setup process, or links to all possible ends:
"Next step: "get started with Spinnaker," and of course link to this guide.
