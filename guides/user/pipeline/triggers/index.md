A pipeline trigger defines when to automatically run a pipeline. There are a
wide variety of triggers available: Jenkins jobs, webhooks, CRON jobs, even
other pipelines. Adding a trigger to your pipeline means that the pipeline will
run each time the triggering event occurs. For more information about how to
configure specific types of triggers, see the rest of the pipeline triggers
documentation.
