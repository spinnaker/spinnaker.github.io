This guide explains how to add a [JFrog
Artifactory](https://jfrog.com/artifactory/) trigger to your pipeline.

# Prerequisites

This guide assumes you have the following:

* An Artifactory search configured in Spinnaker (see the [documentation for the
  `hal config repository artifactory` Halyard
commands](/reference/halyard/commands/#hal-config-repository-artifactory))

* A Maven account configured in Spinnaker (see the [documentation for the `hal
  config artifact maven` Halyard
commands](/reference/halyard/commands/#hal-config-artifact-maven))

* The `artifactsRewrite` feature flag enabled in Spinnaker. In
  `~/.hal/$DEPLOYMENT/profiles/settings-local.js` (where `$DEPLOYMENT` is
  typically `default`), add the line
  `window.spinnakerSettings.feature.artifactsRewrite = true;`.

# Adding an Artifactory Trigger

1. In the __Configuration__ stage of your new pipeline, add a trigger.

artifact.
