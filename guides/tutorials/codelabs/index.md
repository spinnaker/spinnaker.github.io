Run through these codelabs to get hands-on experience with Spinnaker in a guided manner. In general, each of these codelabs is expected to take 1 hour.

## Table of Contents

* [Continuous Delivery to Kubernetes Using Spinnaker](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/cloud-spinnaker-kubernetes-cd/) - deploy an application from Kubernetes manifest files (from the Google I/O 2018 Spinnaker Codelab)
* [Bake and Deploy Pipeline](./bake-and-deploy-pipeline/) - set up a Spinnaker pipeline that bakes a virtual machine (VM) image containing redis, then deploys that image to a test cluster
* [Hello Deployment](./hello-deployment/) - run through the workflow of setting up an example application deployment
* [GCE Source To Prod](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/bake-and-deploy-pipeline/) - create a cohesive workflow which takes source code and builds, tests and promotes it to production with VMs in GCE
* [Kubernetes Source To Prod](./kubernetes-source-to-prod/) - create a set of basic pipelines for deploying code from a Github repo to a Kubernetes cluster in the form of a Docker container
* [Continuous Delivery with Containers on GCP](./gcp-kubernetes-source-to-prod/) - set up a source-to-prod continuous delivery flow for a hello world app deployed via containers, on the Google Cloud Platform
* [Continuous Delivery to Kubernetes on Azure](./azure-kubernetes-source-to-prod/) - deploy a Dev Ops VM with a sample source-to-prod pipeline targeting Kubernetes on Azure
* [Continuous Delivery to Azure VM Scale Set](./azure-vmss-source-to-prod/) - deploy a Dev Ops VM with a sample source-to-prod pipeline targeting Virtual Machine Scale Set on Azure
* [App Engine Source To Prod](./appengine-source-to-prod/) - create a workflow to safely deploy to App Engine from source code
* [Safe Deployments](./safe-deployments) - Enhance an existing deployment process to take advantage of Spinnaker safety features
* [DC/OS Source to Prod](./dcos-source-to-prod) - create a set of basic pipelines for deploying code from a Github repo to a DC/OS cluster
* [Deploying GCS Pub/Sub Artifacts to App Engine](./pubsub-to-appengine/) - Trigger a pipeline from a Pub/Sub message from GCS upon upload of a tarball
* [Automating Canary Analysis on GKE with Spinnaker](https://cloud.google.com/solutions/automated-canary-analysis-kubernetes-engine-spinnaker) - Configure automated canary analysis on GKE
* [Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Source To Prod](./oci-source-to-prod/) - create a cohesive workflow which takes source code and builds, tests, and promotes it to production on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure
* [Continuous Delivery to Kubernetes on Oracle](./oracle-kubernetes-source-to-prod/) - deploy an application from Kubernetes manifest files targeting Kubernetes on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Container Engine
