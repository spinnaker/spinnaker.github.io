In this codelab you will configure a Spinnaker pipeline to deploy an application from Kubernetes manifest files targeting Kubernetes on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Container Engine (OKE).

# Prerequisites

Before we begin, we need to do the following:

### Configure Kubernetes

If you don't already have a cluster for this purpose, you can follow [this tutorial](https://www.oracle.com/webfolder/technetwork/tutorials/obe/oci/oke-full/index.html) until a Kubernetes cluster on OKE is created.

### Create a compute instance

Create a compute instance on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) to host Spinnaker by following [this instructions](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Compute/Tasks/launchinginstance.htm).  Spinnaker supports Ubuntu 16.04.

### Install and configure Spinnaker

SSH onto the compute instance you previously created.  `IP` is its public ip address.

```bash
ssh ubuntu@IP
```

* Install Halyard

```bash
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/spinnaker/halyard/master/install/debian/InstallHalyard.sh
sudo bash InstallHalyard.sh -y
```

* Set up Oracle Object Storage as your Spinnaker storage by following these steps: [Adding Oracle Object Storage to Spinnaker](/setup/install/storage/oracle/).

* Set up your Kubernetes Cloud provider by following these steps: [Setting up OKE](/setup/install/providers/kubernetes-v2/oke/).

* Set up Spinnaker version.  To complete this tutorial, Spinnaker version has to be at least 1.11.x.

```bash
hal config version edit --version $SPINNAKER_VERSION
```

* Execute the following commands to complete the installation:

```bash
hal config deploy edit --type localdebian 
sudo hal deploy apply
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
```

### Accessing Spinnaker

By default, the Spinnaker UI runs on port 9000. You can use an SSH tunnel to access this from your workstation.

```bash
ssh -A -L 9000:localhost:9000 -L 8084:localhost:8084 ubuntu@IP
```

Now Spinnaker UI is available at [http://localhost:9000](http://localhost:9000).

# 1: Create a Spinnaker application

In this exercise, you’ll set up a pipeline to deploy a tomcat8 from Kubernetes manifest file to OKE. 

Navigate to Spinnaker at [http://localhost:9000](http://localhost:9000).

From the Spinnaker home page, create a new Spinnaker Application by clicking on the *Actions* drop down at the upper right and clicking on *Create Application*.

In the *New Application* dialog:

* Enter "codelaboke" for *Name*.
* Enter your email for *Owner Email*.
* Add "kubernetes" to *Cloud Providers*.
* Click the *Create* button.

# 2: Create a load balancer

Navigate to the "Load Balancers" tab and click the *Create Load Balancer* button, enter the following yaml in the *Manifest*:

```yaml
kind: Service
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: codelaboke-test-lb
  annotations:
    service.beta.kubernetes.io/oci-load-balancer-shape: 400Mbps
spec:
  type: LoadBalancer
  selector:
    load-balancer-codelaboke-test-lb: 'true'
  ports:
  - protocol: TCP
    port: 80
    targetPort: 8080
```
The service annotation “service.beta.kubernetes.io/oci-load-balancer-shape” determines the load balancer's total pre-provisioned maximum capacity (bandwidth) for ingress plus egress traffic. Available shapes include 100Mbps, 400Mbps, and 8000Mbps.

Click *Create*. This will create the load balancer shown below.

# 3: Create a "Deploy to Test" pipeline

### Create the pipeline

Create a new pipeline by navigating to the PIPELINES tab and clicking the *New* button

* Name the pipeline “Deploy to Test”.
* Click the *Create* button. 

### Set up Deploy stage

There are multiple ways to deploy Kubernetes manifests using the Kubernetes provider.  More details can be found in this [Deploying Kubernetes Manifests](/guides/user/kubernetes-v2/deploy-manifest/) guide.

It is preferred to use artifacts as manifests.  However, in this tutorial, the manifest is supplied statically to a pipeline as text for simplicity.

* Click *Add stage*.
* Select “Deploy (Manifest)” in the *Type* drop down.
* In the *Deploy (Manifest) Configuration* section, enter the following yaml as *Text* for *Manifest Source*.

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: codelaboke-test-cluster
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      codelaboke-test-cluster: 'true'
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        codelaboke-test-cluster: 'true'
        load-balancer-codelaboke-test-lb: 'true'
    spec:
      containers:
        - image:  tomcat:8.0
          name: tomcat8
          ports:
            - containerPort: 8080
          readinessProbe:
            httpGet:
              path: /
              port: 8080
```

* Save the pipeline.

# 4. Deploy

Run a "Start Manual Execution" in "Deploy to Test" to Test pipeline.

![](deployed.png)

Navigate to the Clusters tab, and you will see this.

You can test the application by visiting the ingress ip address of the Load Balancer "codelaboke-test-lb".  In this example, the Load Balancer listens to HTTP on port 80.
