## Overview

Once you have `spin` installed and configured, you can use it to start
managing your Spinnaker pipelines.

`spin` can manage the whole lifecycle of your pipeline:

```bash
$ spin pipeline

Usage:
   pipeline [command]

Aliases:
  pipeline, pipelines, pi

Available Commands:
  delete      Delete the provided pipeline
  execute     Execute the provided pipeline
  get         Get the pipeline with the provided name from the provided application
  list        List the pipelines for the provided application
  save        Save the provided pipeline

Flags:
  -h, --help   help for pipeline

Global Flags:
      --config string          path to config file (default $HOME/.spin/config)
      --gate-endpoint string   Gate (API server) endpoint (default http://localhost:8084)
  -k, --insecure               ignore certificate errors
      --no-color               disable color (default true)
      --output string          configure output formatting
  -q, --quiet                  squelch non-essential output

Use " pipeline [command] --help" for more information about a command.
```

The following assumes Spinnaker is running and Gate is
listening on `http://localhost:8084`. If Gate is running elsewhere,
you can set the Gate endpoint with the global `--gate-endpoint` flag.

## Managing your pipeline's lifecycle

### Create and update pipelines with `save`

```bash
$ spin pipeline save --file <path to pipeline json>

Parsed submitted pipeline: <...>

# Returns the following message if the pipeline gets updated successfully.
Pipeline save succeeded
```

Note that `save` accepts pipeline in JSON format. You can quickly export an
existing pipeline into a valid argument to the `--file` flag by using the `get` command.
You can also export pipeline JSON from the pipeline UI in Deck by clicking
`Pipeline Actions > Edit as JSON` and copying the JSON contents, e.g.

{% include figure
   image_path="./edit-json.png"
%}

You can also template the pipeline JSON using your favorite templating engine.

### List pipelines in an application with `list`

```bash
spin pipeline list --application my-app

[
...
{
  "application": "my-app"
  ...
}
...
]

```

### Retrieve a single pipeline with `get`

Get a single pipeline with `get`:

```bash
spin pipeline get --name my-pipeline --application my-app
{
  "application": "my-app"
  "stages": [...]
}
```

### Start a pipeline execution with `execute`

Start a pipeline execution with `execute`:

```bash
spin pipeline execute --name my-pipeline --application my-app

Pipeline execution started
```
If your pipeline is parameterized, you can submit a JSON-formatted
map of the parameters and their values either via the `--parameter-file`
flag or via STDIN, e.g.

```bash
{
  "parameter1": "value1",
  "parameter2": "value2",
  ...
}
```

You can pass in paramaters as key-value pairs with the `-p` flag as such:

```bash
spin pipeline execute --application my-app --name my-pipeline -p foo=bar,baz=qux
```

### Delete a pipeline with `delete`

```bash
spin pipeline delete --name my-pipeline --application my-app

Pipeline deleted
```

### Enable/disable a pipeline with `update`

```bash
spin pipeline update --application my-app --name my-pipeline --enabled

# Returns the following message if the pipeline gets updated successfully.
Pipeline updated
```

```bash
spin pipeline update --application my-app --name my-pipeline --disabled

# Returns the following message if the pipeline gets updated successfully.
Pipeline updated
```
