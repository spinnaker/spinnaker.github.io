Plugins are an early alpha feature that is under active development and will likely change.

This guide is for creating a new plugin to Spinnaker. For information about how to use an existing plugin, see [Plugin Users Guide](/guides/user/plugin-users/).

# Create the Backend For Stage Plugins

## Example Plugin

This document shows how to create a simple plugin that waits a random amount of time, from zero to the number of seconds that is entered in the UI. Use this guide as a starting point to facilitate creating more complex plugins. 

## Setting Up Your Project

To get started setting up your project, we highly suggest using [https://start.spring.io](https://start.spring.io/) to create your base project. 

Keep the following recommendations and requirements in mind:

- We recommend making the project a Gradle project. 
- You must set the base package path for the plugin to the following path: `com.netflix.spinnaker.plugin`. You can add anything else after that, but that is required. 
- You can add any dependencies you need to make your plugin successful.

Generate the project and unzip it to a location of your choosing. Modify the `build.gradle`  file to look like the following example:
```
plugins {
    id 'org.springframework.boot' version '2.1.8.RELEASE' apply false
    id 'io.spring.dependency-management' version '1.0.8.RELEASE'
    id 'java'
}

dependencyManagement {
    imports {
        mavenBom(org.springframework.boot.gradle.plugin.SpringBootPlugin.BOM_COORDINATES)
    }
}

group = 'com.netflix.spinnaker.plugin.armory' // make sure this is your package path!
version = '0.0.1-SNAPSHOT'
sourceCompatibility = '1.8'

repositories {
    mavenCentral()
    jcenter()
    maven { url "https://spinnaker.bintray.com/gradle" }
}

dependencies {
    implementation 'org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter'
    testImplementation 'org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-test'
    compile group: 'com.netflix.spinnaker.orca', name: 'orca-api', version: '7.36.0'
}
```
Then, we can remove both of the tests and the main application. (Don’t worry, we will add our own tests!)


## Creating The Plugin Stage

In order to create the stage plugin, we first have to define three classes. The three classes that we need to define are our Stage Input, Stage Output Context, and Stage Output Outputs. 

**SimpleStage Input**
SimpleStage Input is what our stage needs to use to do its job. The stage input comes from the Spinnaker UI. First, we have to create a class that will be used as our Stage input. In this example, the plugin will take the max time to wait.
```
@Data
class RandomWaitInput {
    private int maxWaitTime;
}
```

**SimpleStage Context**
Context is used within the stage itself. In this example, the maxWaitTime will be added here.
```
@Data
class Context {
    private int maxWaitTime;
    public Context(int maxWaitTime) {
      this.maxWaitTime = maxWaitTime;
    }
}
```

**SimpleStage Output**
Output is what can be used later in other stages. In this case, the output contains the actual number of seconds the stage waits.
 
```
@Data
class Output {
    private int timeToWait;
    public Output(int timeToWait) {
      this.timeToWait = timeToWait;
    }
}
```
## Create Stage Class

The stage itself needs to implement the `[SimpleStage](https://github.com/spinnaker/orca/blob/ab89a0d7f847205ccd62e70f8a714040a8621ee7/orca-api/src/main/java/com/netflix/spinnaker/orca/api/SimpleStage.java)` interface. The two methods that we need to implement are `getName` and `execute`.

**getName**
`getName` is a method that tells Spinnaker what the name of the stage is. 

**execute**
`execute` is the meat of the stage. `execute` takes in a `SimpleStageInput` that will take in as a generic the class that was created earlier for stage input. `execute` will return a `SimpleStageOutput` that has our `Output` and `Context` classes. `SimpleStageOutput` also needs to know the status of the stage. This is where the `[SimpleStageStatus](https://github.com/spinnaker/orca/blob/ab89a0d7f847205ccd62e70f8a714040a8621ee7/orca-api/src/main/java/com/netflix/spinnaker/orca/api/SimpleStageStatus.java)` comes into play. Currently stages can be in the following states:

1. Terminal → the stage failed
2. Running → the stage is still executing
3. Succeeded → the stage has successfully completed
4. Not Started → the stage has not started yet

**Putting it all together**
```
public class RandomWait<RandomWaitInput> {
  @Override
  public String getName() {
    return "randomWait";
  }

  @Override
  public SimpleStageOutput execute(SimpleStageInput<RandomWaitInput> stageInput) {
    Random rand = new Random();
    int maxWaitTime = stageInput.getValue().getMaxWaitTime();
    int timeToWait = rand.nextInt(maxWaitTime);

    try {
      TimeUnit.SECONDS.sleep(timeToWait);
    } catch(Exception e) {
      log.error("{}", e);
    }

    SimpleStageOutput<Output, Context> stageOutput = new SimpleStageOutput();
    Output output = new Output(timeToWait);
    Context context = new Context(maxWaitTime);

    stageOutput.setOutput(output);
    stageOutput.setContext(context);
    stageOutput.setStatus(SimpleStageStatus.SUCCEEDED);

    return stageOutput;
  }
}
```
# Create The Frontend For Stage Plugins
## Setting Up Your Project

We suggest React as the framework for the plugin frontend code. When setting up webpack or rollup, make sure that React is added to the resulting transpiled ouput. That way, you can manage your own dependencies as the plugin developer. The only dependency that is needed from Spinnaker is `@spinnaker/plugins`. 

## Writing The Frontend
```
import * as React from 'react';
// IPluginInitialize is function interface
// that takes in the IStageRegistry interface.
// The IStageRegistry is used to register the stage.
import { IPluginInitialize, IStageRegistry } from '@spinnaker/plugins';

// Our stage component
class RandomWaitStage extends React.Component {
  setMaxWaitTime = (event: React.SyntheticEvent) => {
    let target = event.target as HTMLInputElement;
    // @ts-ignore
    this.props.updateStageField({'maxWaitTime': target.value});
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <label>
            Max Time To Wait
            <input onChange={this.setMaxWaitTime} id="maxWaitTime" />
        </label>
      </div>
    );
  }
}

// This function implements the IPluginInitialize interface
// This is where the stage gets registered.
function initialize(registry: IStageRegistry): void {
  registry.pipeline.registerStage({
    label: 'Random Wait',
    description: 'Stage that waits a random amount of time up to the max inputted',
    key: 'randomWait',
    component: RandomWaitStage,
  });
};

// Make the initialize function be the interface
let init: IPluginInitialize = initialize;
const plugin = {
  initialize: init,
};

// Call spinnaker settings to actually load the stage
// plugin for us
window.spinnakerSettings.onPluginLoaded(plugin);
```

**Render Method**
Anything can go in the render method. What is in the render method will be shown to plugin users when configuring their Spinnaker pipeline. In this example, the user can input the maximum number of seconds to wait to continue executing the pipeline.

**Set Methods**
Stages are made up of JSON that contains all information that will be passed to the backend. To update the stage JSON with the data the user enters, use the `this.props.updateStageField` method that takes in a valid JSON object of what to update. In this example, we are updating the `maxWaitTime` field with the value that the user enters.

**Register Stage**
The `registerStage` method is what makes the stage available for use. These are the required fields for registering a stage:

1. key → A unique name of the stage
2. label → Text used inside the UI to display what the name of the stage is
3. description → A short description of what the stage does
4. component → (If using React to create a stage) Place where you would put the component to render

Optional Fields:

- cloudProvider → if the stage can only be ran in one of the cloud providers, that can be selected here.


# Writing The Plugin Manifest

Here is an example of a plugin manifest:
```
name: armory/s3copy
description: Copies S3 files to different locations
manifestVersion: plugins/v1
version: 1.2.3
options:
  s3:
    username: user
    password: pass
resources:
  orca:
  - https://stage-plugin-test.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/stage-plugin-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
  deck:
  - https://stage-plugin-test.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/stage-plugin-ui-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.js
```

The `name` is the name of the plugin that is being written. Names are namespaced so that plugins can have the same name but be made by different vendors. In this case, the namespace is `armory` and the name of the plugin is `s3copy`.

The `description` gives the plugin user an idea of what the plugin will be doing.

The `manifestVersion` tells Spinnaker what version to use to validate the manifest. This is needed because lugin manifests can change overtime. Currently, there is only the `plugins/v1` version.

`version` is the version of the plugin. 

The `options` key gives the plugin users that flexibility to change some settings to control how the plugin works. For example, controlling what username and password to use to connect to S3. The plugin user can modify anything under `options`.

The next section in the manifest is for `resources`. Resources are things that are required for the plugin to run. For example, when creating a stage, there will be jar(s) and Javascript code that need to be consumed by the plugin user. Currently, there are two different types of `resources`. The first is for `orca`.  This is where we list a URL locations of where the jar(s) are for Orca to use.

The second item under `resources` is for `deck`. `deck` is the frontend for Spinnaker. Here is where a list of javascript resources would be put for `deck` to consume.
