## What to hack

Not sure where to get started contributing to Spinnaker? May we suggest these points-eligible contributions:

- Hack on your team’s project as part of our [4 challenges!](hack-logistics.md/#hackathon-challenges)

- Visit the [list of beginner-friendly Spinnaker issues](https://github.com/spinnaker/spinnaker/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22beginner+friendly%22+). Each issue has a Slack channel referencing the issue number (e.g. #gardening-team-issue-5357). Check the channel to collaborate.

- Create a custom-stage plugin and familiarize yourself with using the framework. This uses the new SimpleStage extension point to add your custom pipeline stage to Spinnaker. Read more in the [Plugin Creators Guide](https://www.spinnaker.io/guides/developer/plugin-creators/).

- Stop by the #sig-documentation Slack channel if you want to help out with work related to the spinnaker.io website refresh!

- Open issues, comment on issues and PRs to provide context, and review PRs in [the Spinnaker organization](https://github.com/spinnaker).

- Add quality answers to [questions tagged "Spinnaker" on StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/spinnaker). End your answers with the suggestion that users [join Spinnaker Slack](https://join.spinnaker.io). To get points for your answers, share question links in the __[#gardening-general](https://spinnakerteam.slack.com/archives/CV4A90DPF)__ channel and indicate your username.

- Share a tip in [#spinnaker-tips](https://spinnakerteam.slack.com/archives/C011W1CNW8Y) for a strong chance to be featured on our home page. Include your twitter handle for a mention!

- Share a Spinnaker news item, tutorial, or tweet link in #spinnaker-news on [Spinnaker Slack](https://join.spinnaker.io) to help us build the next edition of [Flying, the Spinnaker Newsletter](/news/latest/). [Sign up for the newsletter](/news/), too!

- - Create a video, tutorial, or stream on something you know how to do in Spinnaker, even if it’s really small. We have a great need for more short (0-5 minutes) training videos for Spinnaker, especially on the basics. [Cloudapp](https://www.getcloudapp.com/) is really useful for quickly making training videos. Share a link to your content in [#gardening-general](https://spinnakerteam.slack.com/archives/CV4A90DPF)with a note that you created it.

- Sign up to receive Flying, the Spinnaker Newsletter.

- Set up a Spinnaker development environment as described [here](/community/gardening/dev-environment/) or using another method. Share a screenshot or clip of your environment in action in #gardening-general. Help us improve this documentation by opening issue(s) or [submitting PRs](https://github.com/spinnaker/spinnaker.github.io/blob/master/community/gardening/dev-environment.md).

- Update library version dependencies. Ask in [#gardening-ineedhelp](https://spinnakerteam.slack.com/archives/CURFZGL2E) channel for guidance.

- Run through a [Spinnaker codelab](/guides/tutorials/codelabs/). Document and file any issues you encounter [here](https://github.com/spinnaker/spinnaker.github.io/issues/) when you come across them. Share your progress in [#gardening-general](https://spinnakerteam.slack.com/archives/CV4A90DPF).
