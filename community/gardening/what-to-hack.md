## What to hack

Not sure where to get started contributing to Spinnaker? May we suggest:

* Join the [Project Matchmaking session](https://armory.zoom.us/j/6807216019) at 8:40 AM PST on Thursday 4/9, right after kickoff. Teams and individuals will take 90 seconds to pitch an idea and invite attendees to a Slack channel to organize.

* Review the [Project Ideas Wiki](https://github.com/spinnaker-hackathon/gardening/wiki/Project-Ideas)for inspiration, then hop over Slack to discuss.

* Visit the [list of beginner-friendly Spinnaker issues](https://github.com/spinnaker/spinnaker/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22beginner+friendly%22+). Each issue has a Slack channel referencing the issue number (e.g. #gardening-team-issue-5357). Check the channel to collaborate.

* Create a custom-stage plugin and familiarize yourself with using the framework. This uses the new SimpleStage extension point to add your custom pipeline stage to Spinnaker. Read more in the [Plugin Creators Guide](https://www.spinnaker.io/guides/developer/plugin-creators/).

* Help make Spinnaker documentation easier to use. Participate in a spinnaker.io card sorting exercise asynchronously. Start [here](https://www.provenbyusers.com/cs.php?c=26cc8242). Stop by the #sig-documentation Slack channel if you have questions or want to chat!

* Add quality answers to [questions tagged "Spinnaker" on StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/spinnaker). End your answers with the suggestion that users [join Spinnaker Slack](https://join.spinnaker.io). To have your answers counted as contributions, share question links in the __#gardening-stackoverflow__ channel and indicate your username.

* Share a tip in #spinnaker-tips on [Spinnaker Slack](https://join.spinnaker.io) for a strong chance to be featured on our home page. Include your twitter handle for a mention!

* Share a Spinnaker news item, tutorial, or tweet link in #spinnaker-news on [Spinnaker Slack](https://join.spinnaker.io) to help us build the next edition of [Flying, the Spinnaker Newsletter](/news/latest/). [Sign up for the newsletter](/news/), too!

* Create a video or tutorial on something you know how to do in Spinnaker, even if it's really small. We have a great need for more short (1-5 minutes) training videos for Spinnaker, especially on the basics. [Cloudapp](https://www.getcloudapp.com/) is really useful for quickly making training videos.

* Open issues, comment on issues and PRs to provide context, and review PRs in [the Spinnaker organization](https://github.com/spinnaker).

* Set up a Spinnaker development environment as described [here](/community/gardening/dev-environment/) or using another method. Help us improve this documentation by opening issue(s) or submitting PRs to the [page](/community/gardening/dev-environment/).

* Update library version dependencies. Ask in the #gardening-ineedhelp channel on [Spinnaker Slack](https://join.spinnaker.io) for guidance.

* Run through a [Spinnaker codelab](/guides/tutorials/codelabs/). Document and file any issues you encounter [here](https://github.com/spinnaker/spinnaker.github.io/issues/) when you come across them.

* Drop in to #sig- channels and ask what they are working on to learn more.
