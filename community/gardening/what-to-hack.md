## What to hack

Not sure where to get started? May we suggest:

* Join the [Project Matchmaking session](https://armory.zoom.us/j/6807216019) at 8:40 AM PST on Thursday 4/9, right after kickoff. Teams and individuals will take 90 seconds to pitch an idea and invite attendees to a Slack channel to organize.

* Review the [Project Ideas Wiki](https://github.com/spinnaker-hackathon/gardening/wiki/Project-Ideas)for inspiration, then hop over Slack to discuss.

* Visit the [list of beginner-friendly Spinnaker issues](https://github.com/spinnaker/spinnaker/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22beginner+friendly%22+). Each issue has a Slack channel referencing the issue number (e.g. #gardening-team-issue-5357). Check the channel to collaborate.

* Create a custom separate stage plugin and familiarize yourself with using the framework. This will leverage the new  SimpleStage extension point to add your custom pipeline stage to Spinnaker. Read more in the [Plugin Creators Guide](https://www.spinnaker.io/guides/developer/plugin-creators/).

* Help make Spinnaker documentation easier to use. Participate in a spinnaker.io card sorting exercise asynchronously. Start [here](https://www.provenbyusers.com/cs.php?c=26cc8242). Stop by the #sig-documentation Slack channel if you have questions or want to chat!

* Add quality answers to [questions tagged "Spinnaker" on StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/spinnaker). End your answers with the suggestion that users [join Spinnaker Slack](https://join.spinnaker.io). To have your answers counted as contributions, share question links in the __#gardening-stackoverflow__ channel and indicate your username.
