The Spinnaker plugin framework simplifies loading and managing third-party extensions. This makes it easier to extend and integrate with Spinnaker, and to share and evolve those extensions throughout their lifecycles. At this stage, the new plugin framework has a growing list of well-defined extension points. It's time for the community to begin leveraging those extension points to add functionality to Spinnaker, and to explore development of new extension points.

## Intro to plugins assignment at Spinnaker Gardening Days

To jump into Spinnaker plugins, start by creating a custom stage plugin. This will help you become familiar with the framework. For your first plugin project, we recommend that you use the new `SimpleStage` extension point to add your custom pipeline stage to Spinnaker. Read more in the [Plugin Creators Guide](https://www.spinnaker.io/guides/developer/plugin-creators/overview/).
