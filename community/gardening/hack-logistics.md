Here's how we'll garden and hack together. Following these guidelines keeps you eligible for prizes and charitable donations, and sets us up for for maximum community impact.

### Create a team Slack channel
_Even if you're starting solo_, create a team channel for your project in [Spinnaker Slack](https://join.spinnaker.io). Use the format __#gardening-team-__+_projectString_ with a project string that describes your project and matches your repo name, if applicable.

### Join project matchmaking
The [Project Matchmaking session](https://armory.zoom.us/j/6807216019) at 8:40 AM PST on Thursday 4/9 will give teams and individuals the opportunity to pitch a project/task and recruit team members. Each spokesperson can take 90 seconds to pitch an idea and invite attendees to a Slack channel to discuss and organize.

### Create repositories
Starting fresh with some new plugin code, or writing a tutorial? Create all new project repositories in [Spinnaker-Hackathon](https://github.com/spinnaker-hackathon). Name your repo with a descriptive project string that you'll use in your Slack channel name. _Note: Your GitHub handle will be added as a member to the Spinnaker-Hackathon organization after check in. You must check in to receive repository creation privileges. Get the check-in link by joining the [Gardening Central](https://armory.zoom.us/j/6807216019) Zoom room._

### Fork Spinnaker repositories
Need to fork an existing Spinnaker project(s) to hack? Fork into the [Spinnaker-Hackathon](https://github.com/spinnaker-hackathon):

When it's time to submit a pull request, do so from your fork. Read more on [best practices in fork & pull request workflows](https://gist.github.com/Chaser324/ce0505fbed06b947d962).

### Use a Spinnaker staging environment
When developing a Spinnaker plugin, it's useful to do integration testing in a running Spinnaker instance. This allows you to interact with the frontend. For this event, Armory will provide Spinnaker staging instances running in AWS for project teams to use as needed.

_Look out for more details on how to gain access to a staging instance._
