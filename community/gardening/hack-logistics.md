We’re evolving the way we garden together. Follow these guidelines to be eligible for prizes and charitable donations all week long, and set us up for maximum community impact.

### Register for the Event
Now when you [register for Gardening Days](https://go.armory.io/gardening), you will answer a set of questions that the Match advisors will use to place you on a team. The week of the event, we will notify registrants of their team placement to confirm participation and provide Slack introductions to teammates. Teams can connect with the Match advisors prior to the event kickoff for help in choosing a project.

### Hackathon Attendee Rewards

All participants earn points, redeemable for prizes, for each individual contribution they make from 12 AM PDT July 16th through 11 AM PDT July 23rd. Review the list of [eligible contributions](what-to-hack.md) to see what’s eligible&mdash;pull requests are most welcome, but count on other ways to add value.

### Hackathon Challenges
Along with individual rewards, we will award team prizes based on an anonymous poll of the Experts panel on demo day. Our prize sponsors will award First Prize and Runner-up prize packages in each challenge category, to be shared among the winning teams.
