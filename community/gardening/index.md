## Register
[Register for Spinnaker Gardening Days](https://go.armory.io/gardening) to join our hackathon and earn rewards for your Spinnaker contributions July 16-23.

## About

Gardening Days rewards new and veteran contributors for building the Spinnaker ecosystem. All contributions attendees make in the week add up to points. This includes project and plugin code, documentation, content, videos, issues [and more](https://spinnaker.io/community/gardening/what-to-hack/). All registered contributors will receive prizes based on their point totals, so contribute when you can. When you [sign up](https://go.armory.io/gardening), you'll be matched with a team. Teams can choose a project and compete in one of [four challenge categories](https://spinnaker.io/community/gardening/hack-logistics/#team-challenges). Teams that demo a project will be eligible for prize packages awarded to challenge-winning teams and runners-up in each category.

Elevate your impact with free compute from AWS, SIG projects in Security, Ops, and more, a global-friendly schedule, and updated documentation and training resources.
