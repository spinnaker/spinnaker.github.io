> A "Product Box" is one of the experiential learning activities that can help a team identify product values. We assume that the product will be packaged in a box for delivery to the customer, and we will design this box together.

- This is a 2.5-hour challenge to simulate a Product Box for Spinnaker
- A DevOps Coach will guide this gamification challenge with step wise methodology, bringing the DevOps way to products
- Best for product teams including product managers, UX designers, architects, DevOps, engineers, and cross-functional teams
- This includes integration of product inception, user research techniques & simulation of user stories along with metrics
