Conference and Meetup Presentations on Spinnaker


### <a href="https://youtu.be/05EZx3MBHSY" target="_blank">Spinnaker: continuous delivery from first principles to production</a>
**Google Cloud Next '17** \| March 10, 2017 \| *Steven Kim (Google), Tom Feiner (Waze)*

Continuous Delivery (and Deploy) is a new look at how we should get our deployable artifacts into production. Google's been doing this for quite some time with success, and we have opinions and corresponding best practices based on lessons we've learned. Steven Kim shares a set of first principles behind continuous delivery with tangible examples from Waze. He also demonstrates how users can take advantage of these first principles today using Spinnaker.

**SpringOne Platform 2016** \| January 24, 2017 \| *Tomas Lin (Netflix)*

Spinnaker is an open source, multi-cloud continuous delivery platform. It is used by over 90% of cloud deployments at Netflix. The Spring Expression Language (SpEL) is heavily leveraged to fully articulate and extend Spinnaker’s automated deployment pipelines. SpEL is used heavily to interact with pipeline stages and triggers for variable substitution, information retrieval and conditional evaluation. This session will walk through the evolution of Spinnaker’s use of SpEL over two years of active development. We will share the code, features and wisdom gained from helping the Netflix and open source community adopt SpEL. You should attend if you are interested in the Spinnaker platform and the continuous delivery pipelines feature, or wish to learn how to fully harness SpEL for your own tools.


### <a href="https://youtu.be/1HiilTXQo4w" target="_blank">Multi-Region Delivery Netflix Style</a>
**AWS Re-Invent 2016** \| December 3, 2016 \| *Andy Glover (Netflix)*

Netflix rapidly deploys services across multiple AWS accounts and regions over 4,000 times a day. We’ve learned many lessons about reliability and efficiency. What’s more, we’ve built sophisticated tooling to facilitate our growing global footprint. In this session, you’ll learn about how Netflix confidently delivers services on a global scale and how, using best practices combined with freely available open source software, you can do the same.


### <a href="https://youtu.be/gPeTuNOcWaY" target="_blank">Open Source Resources</a>
**AWS Re-Invent 2016** \| November 29, 2016 \| *Nadia Eghbal (GitHub), Austen Collins (Serverless), Andy Glover (Netflix)*

This session discusses the open-source community, its vital place within the AWS ecosystem, and how AWS works to provide seamless integration points. Our speakers share their experiences building and deploying cloud-based open-source projects while also reviewing some of today's most popular and relevant open-source platforms and solutions.

**CloudFoundry Summit 2016** \| October 8, 2016 \| *Greg Turnquist (Pivotal)*

How do big shops like Netflix make it possible to deploy hundreds if not thousands of releases every single day? FInd out with a tour through the Spring-Boot based system known as Spinnaker. Spinnaker is the open source continuous deployment tool that supports multiple clouds, multiple languages, and multiple providers. Learn about its pipeline-based, notification-empowered way to execute simple and complex deployment processes with ease while keeping you in control.

**Microsoft Azure Cloud Cover Show** \| May 27, 2016  \| *Andy Glover (Netflix), Richard Guthrie (Microsoft), Arun Chandrasekhar (Microsoft)*

In this episode Haishi Bai is joined by Andy Glover, Richard Guthrie and Arun Chandrasekhar to talk about Spinnaker, Netflix's open source, multi-cloud, global Continuous Delivery platform. Spinnaker is designed to be pluggable, allowing different tasks, models and targets to be incorporated into the deployment pipeline. It supports various deployment targets such as Amazon Web Services, Google Compute Platform, Kubernetes, and Cloud Foundry. Now with Microsoft's contribution, Spinnaker also deploys to Microsoft Azure! After a brief overview by Andy and Arun, Richard and Andy shows a number of deployment pipelines and scenarios to showcase how you can leverage Spinnaker to automate Continuous Delivery pipelines.


### <a href="https://youtu.be/YJm9WS0Mt_0" target="_blank">Streamlining deployment pipelines in a large organisation with Netflix Spinnaker</a>
**Schibsted Media Group** \| March 30, 2016 \| *Gard Rimestad (Schibsted)*

It is usual to have several steps that code needs to go through before it is available to customers. The mix of tools involved in this process often make it hard to make a smooth deployment pipeline where you can see how it is all connected and figure out where the waste is. Spinnaker from Netflix is a system for handling pipelines across various tools and environments (like AWS, GCE, Kubernetes, etc.)

This session will go through how we are solving these challenges with Spinnaker. We will share our experiences, current status and plans. If you don't know Spinnaker don’t worry, we will do an overview for you. We will also talk about the strategies we choose to use in order to keep the transition from old systems to Spinnaker as smooth as possible.


### <a href="https://youtu.be/qamtiWa-Cy4" target="_blank">Deploying your cloud applications to production 4,000 times a day with Spinnaker</a>
**GCP Next 2016** \| March 28, 2016 \| *Matt Duftler (Google), Andy Glover (Netflix)*

With the increased scale and velocity that are possible in moving to the Cloud, there’s renewed focus towards DevOps best practices for safely deploying applications in a disciplined way. In this session, we’ll review practices that we’ve shown to be successful at Google and Netflix. We will also demonstrate Spinnaker, a new open source, extensible, multi-cloud, continuous delivery platform that embodies these best practices to enable safe, frequent, repeatable deployments of applications to the Cloud. Finally, we’ll discuss motivations behind developing Spinnaker for Netflix and Google, show how Netflix is taking advantage of Spinnaker to deploy their applications to production 4,000 times a day, and give a preview of what’s coming next.

How do big shops like Netflix make it possible to deploy hundreds if not thousands of releases every single day? FInd out with a tour through the microservice, Spring Boot-based system known as Spinnaker. Spinnaker is the open source continuous integration/continuous deployment tool that supports multiple clouds, multiple languages, and multiple providers.

**NetflixOpenSource** \| February 11, 2016 \| *Adam Jordens (Netflix), Matt Duftler (Google), Arun Chandrasekhar (Microsoft), David Stenglein (Kenzan)*

Learn more about how we are evolving our open source. In our evolution we’ll discuss how we are approaching project lifecycles, metrics we are tracking that give us insight into the health of our key projects, and how we are working to make this clear to the communities involved with our projects.

Also, we will discuss one of most recent key open source releases – Spinnaker (http://spinnaker.io/). Spinnaker is an open source, multi-cloud continuous delivery platform for releasing software changes with high velocity and confidence. Spinnaker powers thousands of deployments per day across the Netflix service.


### <a href="https://youtu.be/UOkZJazycQs" target="_blank">Microservice Deployment Pipelines With Spinnaker</a>
**microXchg 2016** \| February 8, 2016 \| *Rick Buskens (Google)*

A core aspect of a microservice architecture is individual deployability of services. Thus, orchestrating the roll out of these services should be as easy as possible. Historically Netflix has rolled out deployments using an open-source tool called Asgard. Spinnaker – the successor of Asgard and an open-source project as well – is a complete reimplementation of its predecessor and heavily improved.

The talk introduces Spinnaker, the challenges it's trying to solve as well as the core concepts it's talking about. We then discuss and demo setting up a build pipeline as well as the various options in deployment targets, rollout strategies etc.
