It's not currently possible to submit a PR to adjust a changelog for a version
of spinnaker that's already been released, as they're stored in gists.

Release Managers are responsible for handling edits to existing changelogs. To request a change to a [changelog](https://github.com/spinnaker/spinnaker.github.io/blob/master/_changelogs),
please contact the Release Manager via [slack](http://join.spinnaker.io), in
the [#spinnaker-releases](https://spinnakerteam.slack.com/messages/spinnaker-releases/) channel.
