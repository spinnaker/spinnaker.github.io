The features listed here are delineated by their [Spinnaker release
version](https://www.spinnaker.io/community/releases/release-cadence/). We plan
our releases by dates rather than features to democratize the release process,
so it's possible that not all features planned make it into each release;
please treat this roadmap as aspirational.
