## Q&A

If you have a question that isn't answered by our documents and FAQ pages,
please reach out for help on [Slack](https://spinnakerteam.slack.com).

The Spinnaker team hangs out on Slack in both the <code>#general</code> channel
for general user-related discussions and the <code>#dev</code> channel for
developer-related discussions. Additionally, Special Interest Groups (SIGs) have dedicated Slack channels, like #sig-security for the Security SIG.

Slack requires registration, but the Spinnaker team is open invitation to anyone to register
[here](http://join.spinnaker.io). Feel free to come and ask any and all
questions.

## Bugs and feature requests

If you have what looks like a bug, or you would like to make a feature request,
please use the [GitHub issue tracking
system](https://github.com/spinnaker/spinnaker/issues).

Some things to keep in mind:

* Please search existing issues to see if your issue is already covered. If it
  is, and you have any new information, please add it! It will help us close
  the issue faster.

* If you are filing a new issue, please provide as much background information
  as possible! At the very least, provide the version of Spinnaker you are
  running, and what steps you took to reproduce the issue. The more information
  we have, the faster we can fix the problem.
