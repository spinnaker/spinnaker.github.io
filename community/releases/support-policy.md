## Bugs and Feature Requests

If you have what looks like a bug, or you would like to make a feature request,
please use the [GitHub issue tracking
system](https://github.com/spinnaker/spinnaker/issues).

Some things to keep in mind:

* Please search existing issues to see if your issue is already covered. If it
  is, and you have any new information, please add it! It will help us close
  the issue faster.

* If you are filing a new issue, please provide as much background information
  as possible! At the very least, provide the version of Spinnaker you are
  running, and what steps you took to reproduce the issue. The more information
  we have, the faster we can fix the problem.

## Q&A

If you have a question that isn't answered by our documents and FAQ pages,
please reach out for help on [Discourse](#discourse), [Stack
Overflow](#stack-overflow), or [Slack](#slack).

### Discourse

The [community discourse site](https://community.spinnaker.io) is the preferred
spot for Spinnaker questions and discussion. Some things to keep in mind:

* Please keep bug reports in the the [Spinnaker issue
  tracker](https://github.com/spinnaker/spinnaker/issues).

* If you think your question will involve a lot of troubleshooting and
  back-and-forth questions, you might have more luck finding someone to answer
  you in [Slack](#slack).

### Stack Overflow

Someone else from the community may have already asked a similar question or
may be able to help you with your problem. The Spinnaker team will also monitor
[posts tagged spinnaker](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/spinnaker).
If there aren't any existing questions that help, please [ask a new
one](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/ask?tags=spinnaker)!

### Slack

The Spinnaker team hangs out on Slack in both the <code>#general</code> channel
for general user-related discussions and the <code>#dev</code> channel for
developer-related discussions. You can participate in the Spinnaker
discussions [here](https://spinnakerteam.slack.com). Slack requires
registration, but the Spinnaker team is open invitation to anyone to register
