The Spinnaker releases listed below are top-level versions tying together each
Spinnaker subcomponents' versions. These have been validated together in an 
end-to-end integration test suite curated by the Spinnaker community, and
represent a more maintainable, easy to upgrade Spinnaker. While 
it's still possible to install each Spinnaker subcomponent's versions 
independently, there is no guarantee that they will work together.

If you want to see what each top-level version is comprised of, run 

```bash
hal version bom <version>
```

to see the commit hash and tag matching `version-<version>` of each
subcomponent.
