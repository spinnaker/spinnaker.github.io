Bugs affecting more than one service commonly surface only when the whole system is running. Our continuous integration system builds and runs a suite of integration tests against Spinnaker nightly on real cloud provider infrastructure to detect these bugs.

## Build Cop

The **build cop** responsibilities include:

* Triage integration test failures on `master` and the 3 most recent release branches
* Clean up orphaned resources across target cloud providers
* Route [new GitHub issues](https://github.com/spinnaker/spinnaker/issues){:target="\_blank"} to the appropriate SIG
  (applying GitHub labels as appropriate). You can find the full list of SIGs in the
  [governance repo](https://github.com/spinnaker/governance/blob/master/sig-index.md){:target="\_blank"}
* Observe any systemic problems raised in the [#general](https://spinnakerteam.slack.com/messages/general/){:target="\_blank"}
  and [#dev](https://spinnakerteam.slack.com/messages/dev/){:target="\_blank"} Slack channels
* Log observations and corrective actions taken in the [rotation log](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1T0kifZ0C7zSIKOy2McKfmDnwvmRuU5Z3t81Tly6kH1M/edit#){:target="\_blank"}

## Process Structure

The CI system comprises both _jobs_, which do a specific task, and _flows_, which invoke a series of jobs.

[`Flow_BuildAndValidate`](https://builds.spinnaker.io/job/Flow_BuildAndValidate/){:target="\_blank"} is the primary entry point for the `master` branch flow.

`Flow_BuildAndValidate_<version>` is the the entry point for the respective top-level release. It is a copy of the primary `Flow_BuildAndValidate` when that release was cut. Top-level release flows work off their respective `release-1.ABC.x` branches.

As its name implies, `Flow_BuildAndValidate` builds and tests the whole Spinnaker system. It follows this general process:

### 1. [Build_PrimaryArtifacts](https://builds.spinnaker.io/job/Build_PrimaryArtifacts/){:target="\_blank"}

1. `git checkout` all services
1. Constructs a BOM from the most recent commit on the target branch
1. Builds a Docker container and a Debian package of each Spinnaker microservice.
1. Builds additional supporting artifacts:
  * `halyard`
  * `spin-cli`
  * Changelog
1. Publishes the BOM under the following names:
  * _With the floating tag:_ `<branchName>-latest-unvalidated` (e.g. `master-latest-unvalidated`)
  * _With a fixed tag:_ `<branchName>-<timestamp>` (e.g. `master-20191213154039`)
1. Publishes the changelog

### 2. [Validate_BomAndReportMultiPlatform](https://builds.spinnaker.io/job/Validate_BomAndReportMultiPlatform/){:target="\_blank"}

For uninteresting reasons, this job must wrap the following `ValidateBomMultiPlatform` in order to aggregate its results.

### 3. [ValidateBomMultiPlatform](https://builds.spinnaker.io/job/Validate_BomMultiPlatform/){:target="\_blank"}

This "Multi-configuration project" specifies the same test(s) to run across different environments. This confirms
Spinnaker works whether deployed as a single VM or in a Kubernetes cluster, for instance.

1. Starts Halyard in a new VM
1. Connects to this instance and executes a series of `hal config` steps, including account setup for the managed cloud provider(s).
1. Deploys the configuration with `hal deploy apply`.
1. Invokes [`citest`](https://github.com/google/citest){:target="\_blank"} integration tests against the new Spinnaker instance.
    * `citest` invokes a command to Spinnaker, and then uses the underlying cloud provider's CLI to confirm the expected changes were made. For example, using `gcloud` to confirm a GCE server group was created or deleted.

## Cleaning Orphaned Resources

Occasionally, integration tests fail in a way that is either undesirable or difficult to automatically clean up. Build cops should periodically ensure these orphaned resources are deleted from the following locations:

* [`spinnaker-community` GCP project](https://console.cloud.google.com/home/dashboard?organizationId=912934373776&project=spinnaker-community){:target="\_blank"}
  * [Instance Groups](https://console.cloud.google.com/compute/instanceGroups/list?organizationId=912934373776&project=spinnaker-community&instanceGroupsTablesize=50&instanceGroupsTablequery=%255B%257B_22k_22_3A_22name_22_2C_22t_22_3A10_2C_22v_22_3A_22_5C_22gcp*_5C_22_22%257D%255D){:target="\_blank"} named `gcp<testName>-*`
  * [VMs](https://console.cloud.google.com/compute/instances?organizationId=912934373776&project=spinnaker-community&instancessize=50&instancesquery=%255B%257B_22k_22_3A_22name_22_2C_22t_22_3A10_2C_22v_22_3A_22_5C_22jenkins-validate-bom*_5C_22_22%257D%255D){:target="\_blank"} named `jenkins-validate-bom-*`
  * [Load balancers](https://console.cloud.google.com/net-services/loadbalancing/loadBalancers/list?project=spinnaker-community&organizationId=912934373776&filter=%255B%257B_22k_22_3A_22Name_22_2C_22t_22_3A10_2C_22v_22_3A_22_5C_22gcp*_5C_22_22%257D%255D){:target="\_blank"} named `gcp<testName>-*`
  * [Managed certificates](https://console.cloud.google.com/net-services/loadbalancing/advanced/sslCertificates/list?project=spinnaker-community&organizationId=912934373776&sslCertificateTablesize=50&sslCertificateTablequery=%255B%257B_22k_22_3A_22domain_22_2C_22t_22_3A10_2C_22v_22_3A_22_5C_22localhost_5C_22_22%257D%255D){:target="\_blank"} that are _**not**_ `builds.spinnaker.io` (!)

## Deleting Obsolete Artifacts

The following jobs assist in removing old artifacts created during the build process:
* [Admin_DailyJanitor](https://builds.spinnaker.io/view/5%20Admin/job/Admin_DailyJanitor/){:target="\_blank"}
* [Admin_AuditBoms](https://builds.spinnaker.io/view/5%20Admin/job/Admin_AuditBoms/){:target="\_blank"}
* [Admin_DeleteObsoleteArtifacts](https://builds.spinnaker.io/view/5%20Admin/job/Admin_DeleteObsoleteArtifacts/){:target="\_blank"}
