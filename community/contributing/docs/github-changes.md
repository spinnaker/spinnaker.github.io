   1. The **Title** defaults to the file change summary. Update the title so it follows the `<type>(<scope>): <subject>` format. Make sure you include a space after the colon. For example:

      ```
      docs(plugins): add documentation for plugin creators
      ```

      The Spinnaker repositories use a PR title checker, so your PR will fail if the title is not in the correct format. For more information, see [commit message conventions](/community/contributing/submitting/#commit-message-conventions).

   2. The **Leave a comment** field defaults to the file change description. PR descriptions are the first step to helping reviewers and project maintainers understand why your change was made.

   3. Leave the **Allow edits from maintainers** checkbox selected.
