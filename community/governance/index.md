The Spinnaker OSS project is run by a group of appointed members who hold specific roles, managed by the technical oversight committee. The steering committee manages the governance structure of the project, revisiting and refining it as needs evolve.

The broader community is organized around a set of special interest groups (SIGs) focused on particular areas of interest.

## Roles

To make clearer to community members how they might progressively get more involved and take more ownership in the project, we define the following appointed roles with their respective duties and qualifications.

Roles are appointed by the Technical Oversight Committee (TOC). Roles can be revoked for reasons such as falling out of qualification, inactivity, or for violations of community guidelines.

## SIGS

SIGs (special interest groups) are created as community interest and demand around particular topics become self evident, and continue on as their relevance and needs do. SIGs and their leads are ratified and greenlit by the [steering committee](#steering-committee).
