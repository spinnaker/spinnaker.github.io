SIGs exist so members of the community can discuss some of Spinnaker's core
feature areas, and guide design in those areas.

* SIGs are created as needed
* Each SIG has one or more "leads", who own the SIG's agenda
* Anyone can attend a SIG meeting

# Existing SIGs

If you think a new SIG should be launched in support of an under-served and important need in the project, please reach out to the [steering committee](/community/governance/#steering-committee) to start one!
