Setting up automated canary analysis in Spinnaker consists of running a bunch
of Halyard commands, as described in this doc. Before you can use the canary
analysis service, you must configure at least one metrics service, and at least
one storage service. The most common setup is to have one metrics service
configured (e.g. Stackdriver, Atlas, Prometheus, Datadog or New Relic) and one storage
service (e.g. S3, GCS or Minio) configured. For further details, [here's a
comprehensive reference](/reference/halyard/commands/#hal-config-canary).

## Quick start

If you'd prefer to just get up and running quickly now, this set of sample Halyard commands will enable
Kayenta and configure it to retrieve metrics from Stackdriver and use GCS for persistent storage:

```
hal config canary enable
hal config canary google enable
hal config canary google account add my-google-account \
  --project $PROJECT_ID \
  --json-path $JSON_PATH \
  --bucket $MY_SPINNAKER_BUCKET
hal config canary google edit --gcs-enabled true \
  --stackdriver-enabled true
```

In the commands above...

`$PROJECT_ID` is your GCP project ID

`$JSON_PATH` points to your service account JSON file&mdash;don't include quotes

`$MY_SPINNAKER_BUCKET` points to a GCS bucket that accepts your credentials.

These can be the same values you used when configuring your other Spinnaker
services (like Clouddriver).

> __Note__ All canary-specific Halyard commands require Halyard version 0.46.0
> or later.
>
> `sudo update-halyard`
>
> or
>
> `sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install halyard`

Next, set the Spinnaker version to v1.7.0 or higher:

`hal config version edit --version 1.7.0`

Lastly, update your Spinnaker deployment to include Kayenta:

`hal deploy apply` (to Kubernetes)
`sudo hal deploy apply` (to local VM)

## Enable/disable canary analysis

```
hal config canary enable
```

```
hal config canary disable
```

## Specify the scope of canary configs

By default, each [canary configuration](/guides/user/canary/config/) is
visible to all pipeline canary stages in all apps. But you can change that so
each canary config can be used only within the Spinnaker application in which it
was created:

```
hal config canary edit --show-all-configs-enabled false
```

Set it to `true` to revert to global visibility.

## Set the canary judge

The current default judge is `NetflixACAJudge-v1.0`. The behavior of this judge
is described [here](/guides/user/canary/judge/).

If there are any other judges available in your world, you can set Spinnaker to
use it:

```
hal config canary edit --default-judge JUDGE
```

## Identify your metrics provider

```
hal config canary edit --default-metrics-store STORE
```

`STORE` can be...

* `atlas`
* `datadog`
* `stackdriver`
* `prometheus`
* `newrelic`

## Provide the default metrics account

Add the account name to use for your metrics provider. This default can be
overridden in [canary configuration](/guides/user/canary/config/).

```
hal config canary edit --default-metrics-account ACCOUNT
```

## Provide the default storage account

Add the account name for your [storage provider](/setup/install/storage).
This default can be overridden in [canary
configuration](/guides/user/canary/config/).

```
hal config canary edit --default-storage-account ACCOUNT
```

## Set up canary analysis for AWS
