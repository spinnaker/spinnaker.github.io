[Minio](https://www.minio.io/) is an S3-compatible object store that you can
host yourself. This is the persistent storage solution we recommend when you
don't want to depend on a cloud provider to host your Spinnaker data. 

## Prerequisites

Install Minio following the instructions on the [Minio
homepage](https://www.minio.io/), making sure to have it run on an endpoint
reachable by Spinnaker. Record the following values:

* `ENDPOINT`: The fully-qualifed endpoint Minio is reachable on. If Minio is
  running on the same machine as Spinnaker, this might be
  `http://localhost:9001`.

* `MINIO_ACCESS_KEY`, `MINIO_SECRET_KEY`: The access/secret keypair you've 
  configured Minio with. These env vars need to be visible to the Minio process
  for them to work.

## Editing Your Storage Settings

Run the following commands (notice we are picking S3 as our storage type,
because Minio implements the S3 API):

# Ubuntu instalation

```bash
echo $MINIO_SECRET_KEY | hal config storage s3 edit --endpoint $ENDPOINT \
    --access-key-id $MINIO_ACCESS_KEY \
    --secret-access-key # will be read on STDIN to avoid polluting your
                        # ~/.bash_history with a secret

hal config storage edit --type s3 
```

# Docker container instalation

```bash
# The next two lines should be run inside the docker container only
chcon -R --reference /root/.bashrc /root/.hal/
ls -lZa /root # Make sure the SELinux context is the same for all files/folders

echo $MINIO_SECRET_KEY | hal config storage s3 edit --endpoint $ENDPOINT \
    --access-key-id $MINIO_ACCESS_KEY \
    --secret-access-key # will be read on STDIN to avoid polluting your
                        # ~/.bash_history with a secret

hal config storage edit --type s3 
```
