The SAML use case is a special one - it's the only one where a user's roles cannot be dynamically 
updated. This is because the user's roles are sent in the initial authentication handshake between
Gate and the SAML Identity Provider (IdP).


## IdP Setup

To enable SAML roles, configure your IdP to include group membership in the assertion
(not covered - some providers may not offer this option). By default, Gate looks for the 
`memberOf` attribute statement, but this can be reconfigured in Gateâ€™s settings.

When Fiat is enabled, SAML groups are automatically pushed to Fiat upon user login and cannot be 
updated until the user needs to reauthenticate.



## Configure with Halyard

SAML roles are automatically pushed to Fiat, so no further configuration is needed.
