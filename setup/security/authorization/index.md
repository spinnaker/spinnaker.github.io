Much like authentication, Spinnaker allows for a variety of pluggable 
authorization mechanisms. This page will illustrate how to setup and configure **Fiat**, 
Spinnaker's authorization microservice.


## Model and Features

Fiat's authorization model is a _whitelist that is open by default_. In other words, when a 
resource does _not_ define who is allowed to access it, it is considered unrestricted. 

Fiat enables the ability to:

* Restrict access to specific [_accounts_](#accounts).
* Restrict access to specific [_applications_](#applications).
* Run externally-triggered pipelines against access-controlled applications using [_Fiat service 
accounts_](#service-accounts).
* Use and periodically update user roles from a backing [role provider](#role-providers).


## Requirements

1. [Authentication](../authentication) successfully setup in Gate.

1. Configured Front50 to use S3 or Google Cloud Storage (GCS) as the backing storage mechanism for
 persistent application configurations.

1. An external role provider from one of the following:
    * Google Groups via a G Suite Account
        * With access to the G Suite Admin console
    * GitHub Team
    * LDAP server
    * SAML Identity Provider (IdP) that includes groups in the assertion 
        > SAML roles are fixed at login time, and cannot be changed until the user needs to 
        reauthenticate.

1. Patience - there are a lot of small details that must be _just_ right with anything related to
 authentication and authorization.

1. (Highly Suggested) All Spinnaker component microservices are either:
    1. Firewalled off as a collective group, or:

    1. Use mutual TLS authentication:

## Restrictable Resources

Accounts and applications access control can be confusing unless you understand the core 
relationship: accounts can contain multiple applications, and applications can span multiple 
accounts.

### Accounts
In the dark ages (prior to Fiat), only accounts could be restricted. Clouddriver is the “one source
of truth” for accounts, so Fiat reaches out to Clouddriver to gather the list of available 
accounts. To add access restrictions to an account, update your `halconfig` to include the 
`requiredGroupMembership` field.

```bash
PROVIDER= # Your cloud provider
GROUP=    # The new group membership

hal config provider $PROVIDER --add-required-group-membership $GROUP
```

Alternatively, you can overwrite the whole list using the `--required-group-membership` flag.


### Applications

One of Fiat’s prime enhancements is the ability to restrict applications. Front50 is the “one 
source of truth” for application configuration, and is also the source of data for application 
permission configurations. The easiest way to add permission configurations to an existing 
application is through Deck:

### Unrestricted Accounts and Applications

It's important to understand what may happen if you leave either an account or application 
without any `requiredGroupMembership` groups.

* If an account is unrestricted, any user with access to Spinnaker can deploy a new application 
to that account. 
* If an application is unrestricted, any user with access to Spinnaker can deploy that 
application into a different account. They may also be able to see basic information like 
instance names and counts within server groups.


## Effects of Restrictions

Because of the new access restrictions, `https://localhost:9000/#/applications` should no longer
list applications that have been restricted. Even navigating to the previously accessible page 
should be denied:

## Service Accounts

A popular feature in Spinnaker is the ability to run pipelines automatically based on a 
triggering event, such as a `git push` or a Jenkins build completing. When pipelines run against 
accounts and applications that are protected, it is necessary to use a Fiat [service account](
./service-accounts/) with enough permissions to access those protected resources.

## Role Providers

To configure an external role provider, follow one of the instructions below:

* [Google Groups with a G Suite account](./google-groups/)
* [GitHub Teams](./github-teams/)
* [LDAP Groups](./ldap/)
* [SAML Groups](./saml/)
