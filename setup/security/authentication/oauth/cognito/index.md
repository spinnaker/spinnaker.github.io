5. After that go to "App integration", then to "App client settings."
    - Select "Cognito User Pool" as one of the "Enabled Identity Providers."
    - Input your callback URL.
    - Check the following

## Configure Halyard

You can configure Halyard either with the [CLI](/reference/halyard/commands/) or by manually editing the hal config.

### Hal config

```yaml
security:
  authn:
      oauth2:
        enabled: true
        client:
          clientId: {CLIENT_ID}
          clientSecret: {CLIENT_SECRET}
          accessTokenUri: {YOUR_DOMAIN_NAME}/oauth2/token
          userAuthorizationUri: {YOUR_DOMAIN_NAME}/oauth2/authorize
          preEstablishedRedirectUri: {GATE_URL}/login
          useCurrentUri: false
        resource:
          userInfoUri: {YOUR_DOMAIN_NAME}/oauth2/userInfo
        userInfoMapping: {}
        provider: OTHER
```

### CLI

1. Set up OAuth 2.0 with AWS Cognito:

`hal config security authn oauth2 edit --provider OTHER --client-id (client ID from above)  --client-secret (client secret from above) --access-token-uri (your domain name)/oauth2/token --user-authorization-uri (your domain name)/oauth2/authorize --user-info-uri (your domain name)/oauth2/userInfo`

2. Enable OAuth 2.0 using:

`hal config security authn oauth2 enable`
