Spinnaker has multiple options for both authentication and authorization. Instead of reinventing
yet-another-login system, Spinnaker hooks into a login system your organization probably already
has, such as OAuth 2.0, SAML, or LDAP.

For authorization, Spinnaker similarly leverages a role-provider that your organization may already
have set up, including Google Groups, GitHub Teams, or LDAP groups.
