 > Note: we recommend that you install Spinnaker following the [standard setup directions](/setup/) rather than the guides listed here.

[Demo installs](/setup/quickstart/) are self-contained simple Spinnaker installations that don't require Halyard. But you can do a fairly quick <em>full</em> install using Halyard, and here
are a few configurations to get you started. If your environment matches one of these, click through for instructions.

* [Halyard on Google Kubernetes Engine Quickstart](/setup/quickstart/halyard-gke/)
* [Halyard on Google Compute Engine Quickstart](/setup/quickstart/halyard-gce/)
* [Public Spinnaker on Google Kubernetes
  Engine](/setup/quickstart/halyard-gke-public/)
* [Deploy to RBAC enabled cluster on Google Kubernetes Engine](/setup/quickstart/halyard-gke-deploy-rbac)
