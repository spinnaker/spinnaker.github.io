There are a few quickstart solutions:

* [Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2016/08/netflix-oss-spinnaker-on-the-aws-cloud-quick-start-reference-deployment/)
* [Google Cloud Launcher](https://cloud.google.com/launcher/solution/click-to-deploy-images/spinnaker?q=spinnaker) 
* [Microsoft Azure](https://aka.ms/azspinnaker)

Keep in mind, none of these are intended for production use. Please follow
[this](/setup/install/) guide if you intend to use Spinnaker for 
more than an evaluation.
