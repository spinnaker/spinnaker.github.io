> ⚠️ Spinnaker's legacy Kubernetes provider (V1) is [scheduled for removal](https://github.com/spinnaker/governance/blob/master/rfc/eol_kubernetes_v1.md) in Spinnaker 1.21.
> We recommend using the [manifest-based provider (V2)](/setup/install/providers/kubernetes-v2) instead. 

{% include toc %}

For the Kubernetes provider, a Spinnaker [Account](/concepts/providers/#accounts)
maps to a credential that can authenticate against your Kubernetes Cluster. It
also includes a set of one or more [Docker
Registry](/setup/providers/docker-registry) accounts that are used as a source
of images.

When setting up your Kubernetes provider account, you will [use halyard to add
the account](#add-a-kubernetes-account) and provide any Docker registries that
you'll use.

## Prerequisites

<span class="begin-collapsible-section"></span>

### You need a Kubernetes cluster and its credentials

You need a running Kubernetes cluster, with corresponding credentials in a
[kubeconfig file](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/cluster-administration/authenticate-across-clusters-kubeconfig/){:target="\_blank"}.

If you have these, and you have
[`kubectl`](https://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/kubectl-overview/){:target="\_blank"}
installed on the machine where you have your `kubeconfig`, you can verify the
credentials work by running this command:

```bash
kubectl get namespaces
```

> Note: Halyard on Docker comes with `kubectl` already installed. Halyard on
> Ubuntu does not.

If you don't have a Kubernetes cluster, you can try one of these hosted
solutions:

* [Azure Container
  Service](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-service/container-service-kubernetes-walkthrough){:target="\_blank"}

* [EKS](https://aws.amazon.com/eks/){:target="\_blank"}

* [Google Kubernetes Engine](https://cloud.google.com/container-engine/){:target="\_blank"}

  See the note below on getting credentials in GKE.

Or pick a different [solution that works for
you](https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/pick-right-solution/){:target="\_blank"}.

Consult the documentation for your environment to find out how to get the
`kubeconfig` that you must provide to Halyard.

#### If your cluster is running on GKE

The simplest way to get credentials is to use legacy authorization.

1. Enable Legacy authorization.

   ![](/setup/install/providers/images/gke-enable-legacy-auth.png)

1. Configure `gcloud` to populate the `kubeconfig` with
[legacy credentials](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/iam-integration#using_legacy_cluster_certificate_or_user_credentials){:target=""\_blank"}:

   ```bash
   gcloud config set container/use_client_certificate true
   ```

1. And get your credentials.

   ```bash
   gcloud container clusters get-credentials NAME --zone ZONE
   ```

However, [you can also use RBAC and a service account](#optional-configure-kubernetes-roles-rbac).

### You need a Docker registry

To use the Kubernetes (legacy) provider, you need a Docker registry as a source
of images. To enable this, [set up a Docker registry as another
provider](/setup/providers/docker-registry), and add any registries that
contain images you want to deploy.

You can verify your Docker registry accounts using this command:

```bash
hal config provider docker-registry account list
```

When you [add your Kubernetes provider account](#add-a-kubernetes-account), you
include your registry (or registries) in the command.

### Optional: configure Kubernetes roles (RBAC)

If you use Kubernetes RBAC for access control, you may want to create a minimal
Role and Service Account for Spinnaker. This ensures that Spinnaker has only the
permissions it needs to operate within your cluster.

The following YAML creates the correct `ClusterRole`, `ClusterRoleBinding`,
and `ServiceAccount`. If you're limiting Spinnaker to an explicit list of
namespaces (using the `namespaces` option), you need to use `Role` &
`RoleBinding` instead of `ClusterRole` and `ClusterRoleBinding`, and create one
in each namespace Spinnaker will manage. You can read about the difference
between `ClusterRole` and `Role` [here](https://kubernetes.io/docs/admin/authorization/rbac/#rolebinding-and-clusterrolebinding){:target="\_blank"}.


```yaml
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: ClusterRole
metadata:
 name: spinnaker-role
rules:
- apiGroups: [""]
  resources: ["namespaces", "configmaps", "events", "replicationcontrollers", "serviceaccounts", "pods/logs"]
  verbs: ["get", "list"]
- apiGroups: [""]

  resources: ["deployments", "replicasets", "ingresses", "daemonsets"]

## Add a Kubernetes account

1. Make sure that the provider is enabled:

   ```bash
   hal config provider kubernetes enable
   ```

1. Assuming you have a Docker Registry account named `my-docker-registry`,
run the following `hal` command to add that to your list of Kubernetes accounts:

   ```bash
   hal config provider kubernetes account add my-k8s-account \
       --docker-registries my-docker-registry
   ```

## Advanced account settings

If you are looking for more configurability, see the available options in the
[Halyard Reference](/reference/halyard/commands#hal-config-provider-kubernetes-account-add).

## Next steps

Optionally, you can [set up another cloud provider](/setup/install/providers/),
but otherwise you're ready to [choose the environment](/setup/install/environment/)
in which to install Spinnaker.
