In [Cloud Foundry](https://www.cloudfoundry.org) (CF), an Account maps to a user account on a CF foundation (a BOSH Director and all the VMs it deploys). You can add multiple accounts for one or more CF foundations.

## Prerequisites

Your CF foundations' [API endpoints](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/running/cf-api-endpoint.html) must be reachable from your installation of Spinnaker.

## Add an account

### Halyard version > 1.15.0

First, we make sure the provider is enabled:

``` bash
hal config provider cloudfoundry enable
```

Next, run the following `hal` command (replacing placeholders with actual values) to add an account named `my-cf-account` to your list of Cloud Foundry accounts:

``` bash
hal config provider cloudfoundry account add my-cf-account \
  --api=[api.sys.endpoint.for.foundation] \
  --user=[user-account] \
  --password=[user-password] \
  --environment=[dev,prod,...] \
  --appsManagerURI=[http://apps.sys.endpoint.for.foundation] \
  --metricsURI=[http://metrics.sys.endpoint.for.foundation]
```

As part of the command execution Halyard will attempt to connect to the Cloud Foundry Foundation and return an error when this attempt fails.

To see the current accounts for the provider run:

``` bash
hal config provider cloudfoundry account list
```

To see details about any account for the provider run:

``` bash
hal config provider cloudfoundry account get [account-name]
```

### Halyard version <= 1.15.0

While the Cloud Foundry provider is in alpha, the hal CLI does not have support for adding a CF account (this support will be added soon). Instead, you can use Halyard's [custom configuration](https://www.spinnaker.io/reference/halyard/custom/) to add a CF account to an existing installation of Spinnaker.

On the machine running Halyard, Halyard creates a `.hal` directory. It contains a subdirectory for your Spinnaker deployment; by default, this subdirectory is called `default`. The deployment subdirectory itself contains a `profiles` subdirectory. Change to this subdirectory (an example path might be something like `~/.hal/default/profiles/`) and within it, create the two files shown below.

Create a file called `settings-local.js`, with the following contents:

```
window.spinnakerSettings.providers.cloudfoundry = {
  defaults: {account: 'my-cloudfoundry-account'}
};
```

This file tells Spinnaker's Deck microservice to load functionality supporting CF.

Create another file called `clouddriver-local.yml`, modifying the contents to include the relevant CF credentials:

```
cloudfoundry:
  enabled: true
  accounts:
    - name: account-name
      user: 'account-user'
      password: 'account-password'
      api: api.foundation.path
    - name: optional-second-account
      api: api.optional.second.foundation.path
      user: 'second-account-user'
      password: 'second-account-password'
```

This file gives Spinnaker account information with which to reach your CF instance.

### For any version of Halyard

If you are setting up a new installation of Spinnaker, proceed to "Next steps" below.

If you are working with an existing installation of Spinnaker, apply your changes:

```
$ hal deploy apply
```

Within a few minutes after applying your changes, you should be able to view the CF instance's existing applications from your installation of Spinnaker.

## Next steps

Optionally, you can [set up another cloud provider](https://www.spinnaker.io/setup/install/providers/), but otherwise you're ready to [choose an environment](https://www.spinnaker.io/setup/install/environment/) in which to install Spinnaker.
