All of Spinnaker's abstractions and capabilities are built on top of the Cloud
Providers that it supports. So, for Spinnaker to be able to do anything you
need to have at least one enabled, with one Account added. If you've picked the
[Distributed](/setup/install/environment/#distributed) deployment you have
already done this step, so unless you want to deploy to multiple Providers, you
can skip this.

## Supported Providers

These are the cloud providers currently supported by Spinnaker:
