{% include toc %}

Halyard is a command-line administration tool that manages the lifecycle of your Spinnaker deployment,
including writing & validating your deployment's configuration, deploying each of Spinnaker's
microservices, and updating the deployment.

All production-capable deployments of Spinnaker require Halyard in order to
install, configure, and update Spinnaker. Though it's possible to install
Spinnaker without Halyard, we don't recommend it, and if you get stuck we're
just going to tell you to use Halyard.

There are two ways you can install Halyard:

* [locally on Debian/Ubuntu or macOS](#install-on-debianubuntu-and-macos)

   This can be on a desktop or laptop computer, or on a VM.
   
* [on Docker](#install-halyard-on-docker)

We recommend you install Halyard on a machine with at least 12GB of RAM.

> **Note**: If you need to run Halyard without access to public internet, read
> [Deploy Custom Spinnaker Builds](/guides/operator/custom-boms/).

## Install on Debian/Ubuntu and macOS

Halyard runs on...

* Ubuntu 14.04, 16.04 or 18.04 (Ubuntu 16.04 requires Spinnaker 1.6.0 or later)
* Debian 8 or 9
* macOS (tested on 10.13 High Sierra only)

Prerequisite:

* Halyard requires Java 11 to be installed

1. Get the latest version of Halyard:

   For Debian/Ubuntu:
   ```bash
   curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/spinnaker/halyard/master/install/debian/InstallHalyard.sh
   ```

   For macOS:
   ```bash
   curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/spinnaker/halyard/master/install/macos/InstallHalyard.sh
   ```

1. Install it:

   `sudo bash InstallHalyard.sh`

   If you're prompted for any information, default answers are usually suitable.

1. Check whether Halyard was installed properly:

   `hal -v`

   If this command fails, make sure `hal` is in your `$PATH`, and check the logs
under `/var/log/spinnaker/halyard/halyard.log`.

1. Run `. ~/.bashrc` to enable command completion.

To get help with any `hal` command, append `-h`. Also, see the [Halyard command
Reference](/reference/halyard/commands).

### Update Halyard on Debian/Ubuntu or macOS

```bash
sudo update-halyard
```

### Uninstall Halyard from Debian/Ubuntu or macOS

> __Important__: uninstalling Halyard deletes the entire contents of your `~/.hal`
directory. Don't do it unless you're prepared to lose your configuration.

1. If you used Halyard to deploy Spinnaker, and you want to purge that deployment,
run the following command:

   ```bash
   hal deploy clean
   ```

1. Now you can safely uninstall Halyard:

   ```bash
   sudo ~/.hal/uninstall.sh
   ```

## Install Halyard on Docker

> Note: If you install Halyard in a Docker container, you will need to manually
> change permissions on the mounted ~/.hal directory to ensure Halyard can read
> and write to it.

1. Make sure you have [Docker CE
installed](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/){:target="\_blank"}.

1. On your current machine, make a local Halyard config directory.


   ```bash
   mkdir ~/.hal
   ```
   This will persist between runs of the Halyard docker container.

1. Start Halyard in a new Docker container.

   The following command creates the Halyard Docker container, mounting the
   Halyard config directory:

   ```
   docker run -p 8084:8084 -p 9000:9000 \
       --name halyard --rm \
       -v ~/.hal:/home/spinnaker/.hal \
       -it \
       us-docker.pkg.dev/spinnaker-community/docker/halyard:stable
   ```

   This runs as a foreground process in your current shell. This is useful
   because it emits all of the Halyard daemon's logs, which are not persisted.
   If you don't care about the logs, and would rather run in detached mode,
   replace the `-it` with `-d`

   > __Note:__ Any secrets/config you need to supply to the daemon (for example, a
   > kubeconfig file) must be mounted in either your local `~/.hal` directory, or
   > another directory that you supply to `docker run` with additional `-v`
   > command-line options.

1. In a separate shell, connect to Halyard:

   ```
   docker exec -it halyard bash
   ```

   You can interact with Halyard from here.

1. Run the following command to enable command completion:

   ```bash
   source <(hal --print-bash-completion)
   ```

To get help with any `hal` command, append `-h`. Also, see the [Halyard command
Reference](/reference/halyard/commands).


### Update Halyard on Docker

1. Fetch the latest Halyard version.

   ```bash
   docker pull us-docker.pkg.dev/spinnaker-community/docker/halyard:stable
   ```

1. Stop the running Halyard container.

   `docker stop halyard`

1. Re-run the container:

   ```
   docker run -p 8084:8084 -p 9000:9000 \
       --name halyard --rm \
       -v ~/.hal:/home/spinnaker/.hal \
       -it \
       us-docker.pkg.dev/spinnaker-community/docker/halyard:stable
   ```

   This re-starts the container using the updated image you got in step 1.

1. In a separate shell, run:

   ```
   docker exec -it halyard bash
   ```


### Uninstall Halyard from Docker

To uninstall Halyard, just delete the container.

` docker rm halyard`

## Next steps

Now that Halyard is running, it's time to [choose your cloud provider](/setup/install/providers/).
