Using [S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/){:target="\_blank"} as a
storage source means that Spinnaker will store all of its persistent data in a
[Bucket](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/details/){:target="\_blank"}.

> :warning: Alternatively, it is possible to use [Minio](/setup/storage/minio)
> instead of the real S3 if you are looking for a local persistant storage solution
> for Spinnaker that is compatible with the S3 API.

## Prerequisites

You need an [AWS Account](https://aws.amazon.com/account/){:target="\_blank"},
and a role or user configured with `s3` permissions.

To grant a user or role `s3` permissions, refer to the
[AWS documentation for creating roles for a user](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_create_for-user.html){:target="\_blank"},
and make sure that both user and role policies grant access to “s3:\*”.

If you are running Spinnaker on an EC2 instance, the instance profile of the instance
Spinnaker is running on  must have `s3` permissions.
If you are running Spinnaker elsewhere (like within Kubernetes) you will need the access
key (secret access key & access key id) of the user you are connecting with in order to
authenticate with `s3`. This user must have `s3` permissions.

## Editing your storage settings

If you do not already have a bucket that you want to use, Halyard will create
one for you (either with the `--bucket` name provided, or with a random string
generated matching `spin-<uuid>`). In either case, you will need to
to supply the new bucket's desired region (e.g. `REGION=us-west-2`).

To configure the S3 settings, run the following (notice, do not supply the
value of `--secret-access-key` on the command line, you will be prompted to
enter the value on STDIN once the command has started running):

```bash
hal config storage s3 edit \
    --access-key-id $YOUR_ACCESS_KEY_ID \
    --secret-access-key \
    --region $REGION
```

If you instead already have a bucket you want to use, or you want to change the
bucket's root folder, check out the additional command parameters in the
[command reference](/reference/halyard/commands#hal-config-storage-s3-edit).

Finally, set the storage source to S3:

```bash
hal config storage edit --type s3
```

## Next steps

After you've set up S3 as your external storage service, you're ready to
[deploy Spinnaker](/setup/install/deploy/).
