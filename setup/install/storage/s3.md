Using [S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) as a
storage source means that Spinnaker will store all of its persistent data in a
[Bucket](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/details/).

> :warning: Alternatively, it is possible to use [Minio](/setup/storage/minio)
> instead of the real S3 if you are looking for a local persistant storage solution
> for Spinnaker that is compatible with the S3 API.

## Prerequisites

You need an [AWS Account](https://aws.amazon.com/account/), and an associated
access key (secret access key & access key id). The service in charge of
storage does not support STS AssumeRole style auth, so the access key & id are
required.

## Editing your Storage Settings

If you do not already have a bucket that you want to use, Halyard will create
one for you (either with the `--bucket` name provided, or with a random string
generated matching `spin-<uuid>`). In either case, you will need to
to supply the new bucket's desired region (e.g. `REGION=us-west-1`).

To configure the S3 settings, run the following (notice, do not supply the
value of `--secret-access-key` on the command line, you will be prompted to
enter the value on STDIN once the command has started running):

```bash
hal config storage s3 edit \
    --access-key-id $YOUR_SECRET_KEY_ID \
    --secret-access-key \
    --region $REGION
```

If you instead already have a bucket you want to use, or you want to change the
bucket's root folder, check out the additional command parameters in the
[command reference](/reference/halyard/commands#hal-config-storage-s3-edit).

Finally, set the storage source to S3:

```bash
hal config storage edit --type s3
```
