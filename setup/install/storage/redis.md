## Prerequisites

Currently, Halyard only allows you to use the Redis instance that Halyard
provisions/installs on your behalf. While this is likely to change, for you
don't need to preconfigure anything to get this storage source working.


## Editing Your Storage Settings

All that's needed is the following command:

```
hal config storage edit --type redis
```
