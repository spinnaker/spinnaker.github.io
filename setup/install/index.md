This section has the steps for installing and configuring Spinnaker.

Using this procedure, the Spinnaker you install is suitable for use in production. 
It's more configurable and available than a [Quickstart](/setup/quickstart/)
installation (though that's a good choice if you just want to evaluate Spinnaker 
without much work). 

## The Process

Installing a complete Spinnaker involves these steps:
1. [Install Halyard](/setup/install/halyard/)
2. [Choose an environment](/setup/install/environment/)
3. [Choose a cloud provider](/setup/install/providers/)
4. [Deploy Spinnaker](/setup/install/deploy/)



## Next Steps

Let's start by [setting up Halyard](/setup/install/halyard/), which will manage
the configuration, installation, and updates of Spinnaker for you.

After this process is done, you can use Spinnaker to create pipelines and deploy software, 
but there are some [further configuration steps](/setup/other_config/) you're likely to need.
