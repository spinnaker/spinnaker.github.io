This section describes how to install and set up Spinnaker so that it can be configured for
use in production. If you just want to evaluate Spinnaker without much work, one of the options
in [Quickstart](/setup/quickstart/) might be a better choice.

## What you'll need

* A machine on which to install Halyard

  This can be a local machine or VM (Ubuntu 14.04/16.04, Debian, or macOS), or
  it can be a Docker container.

* A Kubernetes cluster on which to install Spinnaker itself

## The process

Installing a complete Spinnaker involves these steps:
1. [Install Halyard](/setup/install/halyard/)
2. [Choose a cloud provider](/setup/install/providers/)
3. [Choose an environment](/setup/install/environment/)
4. [Deploy Spinnaker](/setup/install/deploy/)
5. [Configure everything else](/setup/other_config/) (which includes a lot of
  stuff you need before you can use Spinnaker in production)
6. [Productionize Spinnaker](/setup/productionize/) (which mainly helps you
  configure Spinnaker to scale for production)
