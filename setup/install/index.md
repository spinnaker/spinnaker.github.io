This section describes how to install and set up Spinnaker so that it can be configured for
use in production. If you just want to evaluate Spinnaker without much work, one of the options
in [Quickstart](/setup/quickstart/) might be a better choice.

## The process

Installing a complete Spinnaker involves these steps:
1. [Install Halyard](/setup/install/halyard/)
2. [Choose a cloud provider](/setup/install/providers/)
3. [Choose an environment](/setup/install/environment/)
4. [Deploy Spinnaker](/setup/install/deploy/)



## Next steps

Let's start by [setting up Halyard](/setup/install/halyard/), which will manage
the configuration, installation, and updates of Spinnaker for you.

After this process is done, you can use Spinnaker to create pipelines and deploy software, 
but there are some [further configuration steps](/setup/other_config/) you're likely to need.
