Setting up [Jenkins](https://jenkins.io/){:target="\_blank"} as a Continuous
Integration (CI) system within Spinnaker enables using Jenkins as a Pipeline
Trigger, as well as the Run Script stage, which depends on Jenkins as a job
executor.

## Prerequisites

You need a running Jenkins Master at version 1.x - 2.x reachable at a URL
(`$BASEURL`) from whatever provider/environment Spinnaker will be
deployed in.

If Jenkins is secured, you need a username/password
(`$USERNAME`/`$PASSWORD`) pair able to authenticate against Jenkins using
HTTP Basic Auth.

## Add your Jenkins master

1. First, make sure that your Jenkins master is enabled:

   ```bash
   hal config ci jenkins enable
   ```

1. Next, add Jenkins master named `my-jenkins-master` (an arbitrary,
human-readable name), to your list of Jenkins masters:

   ```bash
   echo $PASSWORD | hal config ci jenkins master add my-jenkins-master \
       --address $BASEURL \
       --username $USERNAME \
       --password # password will be read from STDIN to avoid appearing
                  # in your .bash_history
   ```

   > *Note*: If you use the [GitHub OAuth
   > plugin](https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/GitHub+OAuth+Plugin){:target="\_blank"}
   > for authentication into Jenkins, you can use the GitHub $USERNAME, and use the
   > OAuth token as the $PASSWORD.

1. Apply your changes:

   `hal deploy apply`

## Configure Jenkins and Spinnaker for CSRF protection

> **NOTE:** Jenkins CSRF protection in Igor is only supported for Jenkins 2.x.

To enable Spinnaker and Jenkins to share a crumb to protect against CSRF...

### 1. Configure Halyard to enable the `csrf` flag:

```
hal config ci jenkins master edit MASTER --csrf true
```

(`MASTER` is the name of the Jenkins master you've previously
configured. If you haven't yet added your master, use `hal config ci
jenkins master add` instead of `edit`. )

Here's what your Jenkins master configuration looks like in your Hal config:

```yaml
jenkins:
      enabled: true
      masters:
      - name: <jenkins master name>
        address: http://<jenkins ip>/jenkins
        username: <jenkins admin user>
        password: <admin password>
        csrf: true
```

Be sure to invoke `hal deploy apply` to apply your changes.

### 2. Enable CSRF protection in Jenkins:

a. Under __Manage Jenkins__ > __Configure Global Security__, select __Prevent
Cross Site Request Forgery exploits__.

b. Under __Crumb Algorithm__, select __Default Crumb Issuer__.

## Configure script stage

### Purpose
The [Script stage](/reference/pipeline/stages/#script) lets you run an arbitrary
shell, Python, or Groovy script on a Jenkins instance as a first class stage in
Spinnaker. For example, you can use it to launch a test suite from a pipeline
instead of doing it manually.

### Prerequisites

In order to configure a Script stage, you need:

*   A running Spinnaker instance, with access to configuration files
*   A running Jenkins instance at `$JENKINS_HOST`, with a user profile set up
    with admin access

### Configure Jenkins

1.  `ssh` into your Jenkins machine.

2.  Download the [raw job xml config
    file](https://storage.googleapis.com/jenkins-script-stage-config/scriptJobConfig.xml)
    with the command:

    ```bash
    curl -X GET \
        -o "scriptJobConfig.xml" \
        "https://storage.googleapis.com/jenkins-script-stage-config/scriptJobConfig.xml"
    ```

3.  Create the Jenkins job where your script will run. To do this, you need the
    following information:

    *   `$JENKINS_HOST`: your running Jenkins instance.
    *   `$JOB_NAME`: the name of the Jenkins job where your script runs.
    *   `$USER`: your Jenkins username.
    *   `$USER_API_TOKEN`: the API token for your user. You can find this in
        Jenkins in the **Configure** page for your user.

    Then, run the command:

    ```bash
    curl -s -XPOST 'http://$JENKINS_HOST/createItem?name=$JOB_NAME' \
        -u $USER:$USER_API_TOKEN
        --data-binary @scriptJobConfig.xml \
        -H "Content-Type:text/xml"
    ```

4.  Navigate to Jenkins >> the job you just created >> **Configure** and do two
    things:

    1.  Add the GitHub repository containing your scripts.
    2.  Either create a `Spinnaker` node in which Jenkins will run all Script
        jobs, or de-select the **Restrict where this project can be run**
        checkbox.

    At this point, you can manually run the script job in Jenkins (including
    manually adding necessary parameters) and see it succeed.

5.  If your Jenkins master is named anything other than `master` in your
    Spinnaker configuration, you'll need to add the following to
    `orca-local.yml` in order for Spinnaker to find it:

    ```yml
    script:
      master: your-jenkins-master
      job: $JOB_NAME  # from step #3
    ```

You can now use the Script stage in your pipelines.
