Setting up [Jenkins](https://jenkins.io/){:target="\_blank"} as a Continuous
Integration (CI) system within Spinnaker enables using Jenkins as a Pipeline
Trigger, as well as the Run Script stage, which depends on Jenkins as a job
executor.

## Prerequisites

You need a running Jenkins Master at version 1.x - 2.x reachable at a URL
(`$BASEURL`) from whatever provider/environment Spinnaker will be
deployed in.

If Jenkins is secured, you need a username/password
(`$USERNAME`/`$PASSWORD`) pair able to authenticate against Jenkins using
HTTP Basic Auth.

## Add your Jenkins master

1. First, make sure that your Jenkins master is enabled:

   ```bash
   hal config ci jenkins enable
   ```

1. Next, add Jenkins master named `my-jenkins-master` (an arbitrary,
human-readable name), to your list of Jenkins masters:

   ```bash
   echo $PASSWORD | hal config ci jenkins master add my-jenkins-master \
       --address $BASEURL \
       --username $USERNAME \
       --password # password will be read from STDIN to avoid appearing
                  # in your .bash_history
   ```

   > *Note*: If you use the [GitHub OAuth
   > plugin](https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/GitHub+OAuth+Plugin){:target="\_blank"}
   > for authentication into Jenkins, you can use the GitHub $USERNAME, and use the
   > OAuth token as the $PASSWORD.

1. Apply your changes:

   `hal deploy apply`

## Configure Jenkins and Spinnaker for CSRF protection

> **NOTE:** Jenkins CSRF protection in Igor is only supported for Jenkins 2.x.

To enable Spinnaker and Jenkins to share a crumb to protect against CSRF...

### 1. Configure Halyard to enable the `csrf` flag:

```
hal config ci jenkins master edit MASTER --csrf true
```

(`MASTER` is the name of the Jenkins master you've previously
configured. If you haven't yet added your master, use `hal config ci
jenkins master add` instead of `edit`. )

Here's what your Jenkins master configuration looks like in your Hal config:

```yaml
jenkins:
      enabled: true
      masters:
      - name: <jenkins master name>
        address: http://<jenkins ip>/jenkins
        username: <jenkins admin user>
        password: <admin password>
        csrf: true
```

Be sure to invoke `hal deploy apply` to apply your changes.

### 2. Enable CSRF protection in Jenkins:

a. Under __Manage Jenkins__ > __Configure Global Security__, select __Prevent
Cross Site Request Forgery exploits__.

b. Under __Crumb Algorithm__, select __Default Crumb Issuer__.

## Jenkins script execution stage

### Purpose
The script stage lets a Spinnaker user run an arbitrary shell, python, or
groovy script on a Jenkins instance as a first class stage in Spinnaker.
This is good for launching an integration/functional test battery
after a bake and deploy stage from a pipeline instead of doing it manually.

### Assumptions
Here are a few assumptions we make in the following directions:

You have a running Spinnaker instance, with access to configuration files.

You have a running Jenkins instance at `<jenkins_host>`, with a user profile set up with admin access.

### Configure Jenkins
`ssh` into your Jenkins machine.

`wget` or `curl` the [raw job xml config file](https://storage.googleapis.com/jenkins-script-stage-config/scriptJobConfig.xml).

To create the Jenkins job, run:

```
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/xml" -d @scriptJobConfig.xml \
"http://<username>:<user_api_token>@<jenkins_host>/jenkins/createItem?name=<JOB_Name>"
```

where `<JOB_NAME>` is the name of the Jenkins job you create, e.g. "runSpinnakerScript"
and `<user_api_token>` is the API token for your user, located at "/user/<username>/configure".

In the job config in the Jenkins UI, set the GitHub repository containing your scripts as
well as the git credentials.

In the UI, go to `"Manage Jenkins"` >> `"Configure System"` and set your git `user.name` and `user.email`.

At this point, you should be able to manually run the script job in Jenkins
(with parameters) and see it succeed.

### Summary

You should now be able to add a stage called "Script" to your pipelines,
where you can specify:

Repository Url: git repository housing your scripts.
Script path: path from the root of your git repository to your script's
directory.
Command: name of the script with arguments to run.
Among other environment parameters (e.g. image, account, etc).

The current version of the script stage is a bit rudimentary, but we'll
soon have support for a separate "job" stage that will be much more robust and encapsulate
the same behavior as the script stage. The script stage is a temporary
solution for the time being.
