These pages contain instructions for installing and setting up Spinnaker

## Try it out

If you're new to Spinnaker and you want a quick way to evaluate it, try out one
of the [quickstart solutions](/setup/quickstart/). These are demos for
evaluation only and are not suitable for use in production.

## Install it

If you want a more serious, scalable deployment of Spinnaker continue
[here](/setup/install/) to installation guide. All other
resources on this Setup page will assume you're following those instructions.

## Find out more

* If you're curious how Spinnaker works, take a look at the
  [Spinnaker Architecture](/reference/architecture/).
* Take a look at the [Releases](/community/releases/) page to pick a version of
  Spinnaker to install.

## Then what?

After you've done all this setup stuff, go to [Get started using
Spinnaker](/guides/user/get-started/) to get to work.
