Welcome to Spinnaker's setup instructions. These pages are intended as a
starting point and reference for users who want to deploy Spinnaker.

If this is your first introduction to Spinnaker, and you want a quick way to
evaluate it, please try out one of the [quickstart
solutions](/setup/quickstart/). These are intended to serve as an 
evaluation and demo tool only, we don't recommend trying to scale them for 
production use-cases.

If you want a more serious, scalable deployment of Spinnaker continue
[here](/setup/install/) to installation guide. All other
resources on this Setup page will assume you're following those instructions.

## Further reading

* If you're curious how Spinnaker runs when it is deployed, take a look at the
  [Architecture](/reference/architecture/) pages.
* Take a look at the [Releases](/community/releases/) page to pick a version of
  Spinnaker to install.
