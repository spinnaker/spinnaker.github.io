If you've installed Spinnaker, and the API gateway [Gate](https://github.com/spinnaker/gate) is running and accessible 
(e.g., at [localhost:8084](http://localhost:8084)), navigate your browser to `<gate_endpoint>/swagger-ui.html`
to view the auto-generated Swagger UI.

Some of the other Spinnaker services - e.g., Clouddriver, Front50, Rosco, etc. - have their own Swagger UIs. These are each accessible at `<service_endpoint>/swagger-ui.html`.
