Artifacts play an important role in the Kubernetes provider. Everything from
the manifests you deploy to the Docker images or ConfigMaps they reference
can be expressed or deployed in terms of artifacts.

# Manifests as artifacts

There are two ways to deploy a manifest:

* The manifest is supplied statically to a pipeline as text
* The manifest is supplied as an artifact

The image below shows a deploy stage that deploys a manifest stored in a GCS bucket:

{%
  include
  figure
  image_path="./manifest-artifact.png"
  caption="Depending on how this pipeline is configured, it will only run when
  the referenced file in GCS is modified."
%}

# Kubernetes objects as artifacts

Once a manifest is successfully deployed using a pipeline (either from text
or an artifact containing text), it is injected back into the pipeline's
context as an output of the deploy stage. Why this is useful is explained
[below](#binding-artifacts-in-manifests), but for now focus on the distinction between...

1. An artifact representing a manifest stored as text in github:

   ```json
   {
        "type": "github/file",
        "name": "manifests/frontend-configs.yml",
        "reference": "https://api.github.com/repos/your-application/..."
   }
   ```
2. An artifact representing a deployed kubernetes object:

   ```json
   {
        "type": "kubernetes/configMap",
        "name": "frontend-configs",
        "location": "prod",
        "version": "v001"
   }
   ```

As described in the [manifests as artifacts](#manifests-as-artifacts) section,
a deploy stage would _consume_ artifact 1, but _produce_ artifact 2 as an output.

When running pipelines, you can always check the produced outputs for any stage
by examining the execution's "source" directly:

{%
  include
  figure
  image_path="./check-source.png"
%}

## Versioned Kubernetes objects

According to the [Kubernetes reference
documentation](/reference/providers/kubernetes-v2/#resource-management-policies),
certain resources are "versioned," meaning anytime a change is made to an
object's manifest and deployed using Spinnaker, it is redeployed with a
new version suffix (`-vNNN`). This is critical to supporting immutable
deployments, as rolling out new ConfigMaps, secrets, or other versioned
resources should require any manifests that reference them to be updated as
well. Luckily, Spinnaker makes handling these updates easy, as explained
[below](#binding-artifacts-in-manifests).

# Binding artifacts in manifests

Generally, artifacts represent resources that you update as a part of your
deployment/delivery pipelines. Given that Docker images and ConfigMaps are what
will likely be updated within a manifest, we provide easy, first-class ways of
injecting them into your manifests. If you're familiar with [Pipeline
Expressions](/guides/user/pipeline-expressions) and are curious why we don't
just rely on those, read [why not pipeline
expressions](#why-not-pipeline-expressions) below.

Spinnaker binds artifacts in your manifest based on a simple heuristic:

  _When a field's referenced type and value match an incoming artifact's type
  and name, the field's value is replaced with the artifact's reference_

A "field's referenced type" sounds ambiguous, but in practice it's
straightforward. The field `spec.template.spec.containers.*.image` always
refers to a Docker image, so clearly it matches the artifact type
`docker/image`. The field `spec.template.spec.volumes.*.configMap.name`
always refers to a ConfigMap, so it clearly matches the artifact type
`kubernetes/configMap`. The same logic applies throughout.

Let's go through an example to make this clear:

We have the following manifest to be deployed in a Spinnaker pipeline:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  labels:
    app: nginx
  name: nginx-deployment
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: nginx
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: nginx
    spec:
      containers:
        - image: gcr.io/my-images/nginx # possible artifact
          name: nginx
          ports:
            - containerPort: 80
          volumeMounts:
            - mountPath: /opt/config
              name: my-config-map
      volumes:
        - configMap:
            name: configmap             # possible artifact
          name: my-config-map
```

And when the deploy stage executes, we have the following artifacts in our
execution context (likely populated from a trigger event, or prior deployments):

```json
[
  {
    "type": "docker/image",
    "name": "gcr.io/my-images/nginx",
    "reference": "gcr.io/my-images/nginx@sha256:0cce25b9a55"
  },
  {
    "type": "kubernetes/configMap",
    "name": "configmap",
    "version": "v001",
    "location": "default",
    "reference": "configmap-v001"
  }
]
```

The ConfigMap and Docker image are replaced by the artifacts in the context,
and the resulting manifest is deployed into your cluster:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  labels:
    app: nginx
  name: nginx-deployment
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: nginx
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: nginx
    spec:
      containers:
        - image: gcr.io/my-images/nginx@sha256:0cce25b9a55    # bound by spinnaker
          name: nginx
          ports:
            - containerPort: 80
          volumeMounts:
            - mountPath: /opt/config
              name: my-config-map
      volumes:
        - configMap:
            name: configmap-v001                              # bound by spinnaker
          name: my-config-map
```

## Why not pipeline expressions?

[Pipeline Expressions](/guides/user/pipeline-expressions) offer a great way to
reference pipeline context programmatically using short snippets of code. Of
course, it's possible to construct expressions that allow you to
reference the Docker image's reference that triggered a pipeline, or the name
of the ConfigMap you deployed in a prior stage. But we want an easier
way to express updates to these resources, leaving your Kubernetes Manifests
natively deployable without making Spinnaker's expression engine a hard
dependency.
