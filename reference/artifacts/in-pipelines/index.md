Now that you have an idea of [what an artifact is](/reference/artifacts/) in Spinnaker, you need to
understand how it's used within pipelines. An artifact arrives in a pipeline execution either from an external trigger (for example, a Docker image pushed to a registry) or by getting fetched by a stage. That artifact is then consumed by downstream stages based on pre-defined behavior.

Spinnaker uses an "expected artifact" to enable a stage to bind an artifact
from another pipeline execution, stage output, or running environment. 

# Expected artifacts

An "expected artifact" is a specification of what properties (found in the URI decoration) against which to match when searching for the desired artifact, plus optional fallback behavior.

Expected artifacts exist for two reasons:

1. To declare what artifacts need to be present at a certain point during
   execution
2. To provide easy ways to reference those artifacts

An expected artifact consists of an artifact to _match_
(by name, type, etc...) plus, optionally, what to do if no artifact is
matched.  When an artifact is matched, we say it's _bound_ to that expected
artifact.

The matching behavior is as follows: The artifact to match declared by the
expected artifact has the same format as a regular artifact; however, its
values are interpreted as regular expressions to match the corresponding values
in the incoming artifact:
- Normal strings must match exactly for the artifact to match because Spinnaker
effectively treats them as regular expressions. For example, Spinnaker
interprets `inputstring` as `^inputstring$`.
- Explicit regular expressions are also valid. For example, Spinnaker
 matches `.*inputstring.*` to any string including the substring `inputstring`.

| Match Artifact | Incoming Artifact | Matches?  |
|-|-|-|
| `{"type": "docker/image"}` | `{"type": "docker/image", "reference: "gcr.io/image"}` | ✔ |
| `{"type": "docker/image"}` | `{"type": "gce/image", "reference: "www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects..."}` | ✘ |
| `{"type": "docker/image", "version": "v1"}` | `{"type": "docker/image", "reference: "gcr.io/image:test", "version": "v1"}` | ✔ |
| `{"type": "docker/image", "version": "v1"}` | `{"type": "docker/image", "reference: "gcr.io/image:test", "version": "v1.2"}` | ✘ |
| `{"type": "docker/image", "version": "v1\..*"}` | `{"type": "docker/image", "reference: "gcr.io/image:v1.2", "version": "v1.2"}` | ✔ |
| `{"type": "docker/image", "version": "v1\..*"}` | `{"type": "docker/image", "reference: "gcr.io/image:test", "version": "test"}` | ✘ |

## Triggers

In Pipeline Configuration, you can now declare which
artifacts a pipeline expects to have present before the pipeline starts
running.

{% include figure
   image_path="./expected-artifact-trigger.png"
   caption="The UI provides short-hand for defining some types of
            artifacts&mdash;in this example a docker image. This is optional, but helps
            quickly define common types of artifacts."
%}

You can define fallback behavior for when the artifact
isn't bound at the start of the Pipeline. The two options are evaluated in
order:

1. __Use Prior Execution__

   Use the artifact bound by the pipeline's previous execution. This is useful in cases where multiple
   sources can trigger the pipeline, but each has incomplete information about
   what artifacts to supply.

2. __Use Default Artifact__

   Specify exactly which artifact to bind.

Once you have declared which artifacts are expected by this pipeline, you can
assign expected artifacts to individual triggers.

{% include figure
   image_path="./pubsub-trigger-artifact.png"
   caption="A pubsub subscription configured to listen to changes in
            one GCR registry. Since this registry can contain many
            repositories, we've assigned it an expected artifact to ensure only
            changes in one repository can run this pipeline."
%}

When a trigger has one or more expected artifacts, it only runs when each
expected artifact can bind to one of the artifacts in the trigger's payload.

### Artifacts in trigger payloads

Artifacts are supplied by payload as a list of artifacts in a top-level
`artifacts` key&mdash;the value is automatically injected into any triggered
pipeline's execution context. However, it's possible that you're not the author
of the incoming message, and are instead depending on a third-party system to
provide an event to Spinnaker to trigger a pipeline. If this event contains
information such as "these images were created," or "these files were
modified," it's useful to be able to extract artifacts from that payload.

For this reason, we allow you to supply [Jinja
templates](http://jinja.pocoo.org/) that transform the incoming payload into a
list of artifacts to be injected into your pipeline.

Take for example the [notification format for
GCR](https://cloud.google.com/container-registry/docs/configuring-notifications#notification_examples).
While it captures the information we need, it's not in the format we want. So,
we can register the following Jinja template for our GCR subscription:

```json
[
  {
    {% raw %}
    {% set split = digest.split("@") %}
    "reference": "{{ digest }}",
    "name": "{{ split[0] }}",
    "version": "{{ split[1] }}",
    "type": "docker/image"
    {% endraw %}
  }
]
```

## Find artifact from execution

To allow you to promote artifacts between executions, you can make use of the
"Find Artifact from Execution" stage. All that's required is the pipeline ID
whose execution history to search, and an expected artifact to bind.

{% include figure
   image_path="./find-artifact-from-execution.png"
%}

A common use case would be to "promote" the image deployed to staging to a
pipeline that's deploying to production.


## Passing artifacts between pipelines

Artifacts can be passed between pipelines.  If a pipeline triggers the execution of a second pipeline,
this second pipeline will have access to any artifacts that were available to the first pipeline;
this includes both artifacts in the first pipeline's trigger as well as artifacts emitted by the
first pipeline.

Two concrete cases where artifacts can be passed are as follows:

1. __Pipeline triggered by the completion of another pipeline__

   To set up this configuration, go to the _Configuration_ screen for a pipeline (Pipeline B) and
   add an automated trigger of type _Pipeline_ pointing to another pipeline (Pipeline A).  Whenever
   Pipeline A completes, it will trigger a run of Pipeline B, and Pipeline B will have access to
   all artifacts from Pipeline A.

2. __Pipeline that is a stage of a parent pipeline__

   To set up this configuration, go to the parent pipeline (Pipeline A), choose _Add Stage_, and add
   a stage of type _Pipeline_ pointing to another pipeline (Pipeline B).  In this case, Pipeline B
   will have access to any artifacts from Pipeline A that are upstream from where it was triggered.

## Stages that produce artifacts

Stages can be configured to 'Produce' artifacts if they expose the following
Stage configuration:

{%
   include
   figure
   image_path="./produced-artifact.png"
%}

If you are configuring your stages using JSON, the expected artifacts are
placed in a top-level `expectedArtifacts: []` list.

There are two ways to use this:

1. __To bind artifacts injected into the stage context__

   If your stage emits artifacts (such as a "Deploy (Manifest)" stage) into the
   pipeline context, you can match against these artifacts for downstream
   stages to consume.

2. __To artificially inject artifacts into the stage context__

   If you are running a stage that does not natively emit artifacts (such as
   the "Run Job" stage), you can use the default artifact, which always binds
   to the expected artifact, to be injected into the pipeline each time it is
   run. _Keep in mind:_ If the matching artifact is empty, it will bind any
   artifact, and your default artifact will not be used.

# A visual explanation

To help explain how artifacts & expected artifacts work, let's walk through a
demo pipeline. To begin, here is the key:

{%
   include
   figure
   image_path="./key.svg"
%}

Say we've configured the following pipeline:

{%
   include
   figure
   image_path="./configuration.svg"
   caption="The pipeline declares that it expects an artifact matching _1_
   (perhaps a docker image) _when the pipeline starts_. This is done in the
   pipeline configuration tab. It also expects an artifact matching _2_ in
   pipeline stage _B_ (perhaps a \"Find Artifact from Execution\" stage)."
%}

The pipeline is triggered by some source (maybe a Webhook) supplying two
artifacts:

{%
   include
   figure
   image_path="./trigger.svg"
%}

Artifact _1_ is bound, but both incoming artifacts are placed into the trigger,
so any downstream stages (in this case all of them) can consume them. The
advantage of the expected artifact is that stages can _explicitly_ reference
whatever artifact is bound downstream, rather than have to check for existance
of the artifact at runtime.

{%
   include
   figure
   image_path="./running-a.svg"
%}

It's important to keep in mind that artifact _1_ was bound when the pipeline
started. If we reference the expected artifact downstream (such as in the
"Deploy Manifest") stage shown below, it is using the artifact that was bound
when the pipeline first executed, not when the stage shown runs.

{%
   include
   figure
   image_path="./artifact-1.png"
%}

When stage _B_ starts executing, it needs to bind expected artifact _2_. If,
for example, it was a "Find Artifact from Execution" stage, it would do so by
looking up the artifact from a another pipeline's execution, and binding it
here.

{%
   include
   figure
   image_path="./running-b-d.svg"
%}

If stages _C_ or _D_ needed to reference an upstream artifact, they would have
different artifacts accessible to them, since they have different upstream
stages. For examples, stage _D_ does not have access to artifact _2_.

{%
   include
   figure
   image_path="./running-c-d.svg"
%}
