This page describes how you can configure a Halyard deployment to increase the availability of specific services beyond simply [horizontally scaling](/setup/productionize/scaling/horizontal-scaling/) the service. Halyard does this by splitting the functionalities of a service into separate logical roles. The benefits of doing this is specific to the service that is being split. These deployment strategies are inspired by [Netflix's large scale experience](https://blog.spinnaker.io/scaling-spinnaker-at-netflix-part-1-8a5ae51ee6de).

When split, the new logical services are given new names. This means that these logical services can be configured and scaled independently of each other.

Currently, this feature is only for Clouddriver and Echo.

__Important:__ Halyard only supports this functionality for a [distributed Spinnaker deployment](/setup/install/environment/#distributed-installation) configured with a [manifest-based Kubernetes provider](/setup/install/providers/kubernetes-v2/).

## HA Clouddriver

 clouddriver --> clouddriver-rw(Clouddriver-RW);
 clouddriver --> clouddriver-ro(Clouddriver-RO);

 classDef split fill:#42f4c2,stroke:#39546a;
 class clouddriver-caching,clouddriver-ro,clouddriver-rw,echo-scheduler,echo-slave split
 </div>

 {% include mermaid %}

Clouddriver benefits greatly from isolating its operations into separate services. To split Clouddriver for increased availability, run:

```bash
hal config deploy ha clouddriver enable
```

When Spinnaker is deployed with this flag enabled, Clouddriver will be deployed as three different services, each only performing a subset of the base Clouddriver's operations:

* [`clouddriver-caching`](#clouddriver-caching)
* [`clouddriver-rw`](#clouddriver-rw)
* [`clouddriver-ro`](#clouddriver-ro)

Although by default the three Clouddriver services will communicate with the global Redis (all Spinnaker services speak to this Redis) provided by Halyard, it is recommended that the logical Clouddriver services be configured to communicate with an external Redis service. To be most effective, `clouddriver-ro` should be configured to speak to a Redis read replica, while the other two should be configured to speak to the master. This is handled automatically by Halyard if the user provides the two endpoints using this command:

```bash
hal config deploy ha services clouddriver edit --redis-master-endpoint $REDIS_MASTER_ENDPOINT --redis-slave-endpoint $REDIS_SLAVE_ENDPOINT
```

More information on Redis replication can be [found here](https://redis.io/topics/replication).

### `clouddriver-caching`

The first of the three logical Clouddriver services is the `clouddriver-caching` service. This service caches and retrieves cloud infrastructure data. Since this is all that `clouddriver-caching` is doing, there is no communication between this service and any other Spinnaker service.

This service's name when [configuring its sizing](/reference/halyard/component-sizing/) is `spin-clouddriver-caching`.

To add a [custom profile](/reference/halyard/custom/#custom-profiles) or [custom service settings](/reference/halyard/custom/#custom-service-settings) for this service, use the name `clouddriver-caching`.

### `clouddriver-rw`

The second logical Clouddriver service is the `clouddriver-rw` service. This service handles all mutating operations aside from what the `clouddriver-caching` service does. This service can be scaled to handle an increased number of writes.

This service's name when [configuring its sizing](/reference/halyard/component-sizing/) is `spin-clouddriver-rw`.

To add a [custom profile](/reference/halyard/custom/#custom-profiles) or [custom service settings](/reference/halyard/custom/#custom-service-settings) for this service, use the name `clouddriver-rw`.

### `clouddriver-ro`

The `clouddriver-ro` service handles all read requests to Clouddriver. This service can be scaled to handle an increased number of reads.

This service's name when [configuring its sizing](/reference/halyard/component-sizing/) is `spin-clouddriver-ro`.

To add a [custom profile](/reference/halyard/custom/#custom-profiles) or [custom service settings](/reference/halyard/custom/#custom-service-settings) for this service, use the name `clouddriver-ro`.

## HA Echo

 <div class="mermaid">
 graph TB

 echo(Echo) --> echo-scheduler(Echo-Scheduler);
 echo(Echo) --> echo-slave(Echo-Slave);

 classDef default fill:#d8e8ec,stroke:#39546a;
 linkStyle default stroke:#39546a,stroke-width:1px,fill:none;

 classDef split fill:#42f4c2,stroke:#39546a;
 class clouddriver-caching,clouddriver-ro,clouddriver-rw,echo-scheduler,echo-slave split
 </div>

 {% include mermaid %}

Echo can be split into two separate services that handle different operations. To split Echo for increased availability, run:

```bash
hal config deploy ha echo enable
```

When Spinnaker is deployed with this enabled, Echo will be deploy as two different services:

* [`echo-scheduler`](#echo-scheduler)
* [`echo-slave`](#echo-slave)

Although the logical Echo services still cannot be horizontally scaled, splitting the services will reduce the load on both.

### `echo-scheduler`

The `echo-scheduler` service handles scheduled tasks, or cron-jobs. Since it performs its tasks periodically (no triggers) there is no need for communication with other Spinnaker services.

This service's name when [configuring its sizing](/reference/halyard/component-sizing/) is `spin-echo-scheduler`. To avoid duplicate triggering, this service must be deployed with exactly one pod.

To add a [custom profile](/reference/halyard/custom/#custom-profiles) or [custom service settings](/reference/halyard/custom/#custom-service-settings) for this service, use the name `echo-scheduler`.

### `echo-slave`

The `echo-slave` service handles all operations of Echo besides the cron-jobs.

This service's name when [configuring its sizing](/reference/halyard/component-sizing/) is `spin-echo-slave`. To avoid duplicate triggering, this service must be deployed with exactly one pod.

To add a [custom profile](/reference/halyard/custom/#custom-profiles) or [custom service settings](/reference/halyard/custom/#custom-service-settings) for this service, use the name `echo-slave`.

## HA Topology

With all services enabled for high availability, the new architecture looks like this:
