While Halyard handles the majority of Spinnaker configuration, there will
always be feature flags and properties either too new or niche to be supported
by Halyard. Furthermore, some users will be more comfortable forgoing Halyard's
configuration generation, or will want to port their old Spinnaker
configuration into Halyard. For these users & use-cases, Halyard supports
custom [Profiles](/reference/halyard/#profiles), and custom [Service
Settings](/reference/halyard/#service-settings).

## Custom Profiles versus Service settings

The two most common ways of customizing your Spinnaker installation is through the use of either a custom profile, for example `clouddriver-local.yml`, or a service setting, for example `clouddriver.yml`. Each of these is created in separate subfolders inside the main Halyard deployment profile folder. In a `default` Halyard profile, this means profiles go in `.hal/default/profiles/` while service settings go in `.hal/default/service-settings`.

 Custom profiles are configuration files that override the default configuration files for each Spinnaker Service. Service-Settings are used by Halyard to determine how to build the Spinnaker deployment and contain information specific to how each Spinnaker Service will be deployed.

For example, if you want to substitute which image file will be used for a Spinnaker service, or what environment variables the service will be run with, then you'll need to modify the service settings for that service.

To override the debugging level specified in `clouddriver.yml`, create a custom `clouddriver-local.yml` file and put it in the `/profiles/` directory.

## Custom Profiles

If you want to supply custom Profiles, for a particular
[Deployment](/reference/halyard/#deployments) (`$DEPLOYMENT`, typically
`default`) place them in `~/.hal/$DEPLOYMENT/profiles/`. The will override any
profiles generated by Halyard, and will be copied over by Profile name.

For example, if you want to supply a different `clouddriver.yml`, you can do so
by placing it in `~/.hal/$DEPLOYMENT/profiles/clouddriver.yml`, and running
`hal deploy apply`.

For any of the Spring based services, any profile matching
`${SERVICENAME}-.*\.yml` will be copied and applied to `$SERVICENAME`. Since
this approach will completely overwrite the generated service, and you may want
to only supply a few flags, you can instead provide them in
`${SERVICENAME}-local.yml`, which will always be loaded by `$SERVICENAME` with
no further configuration needed. Further [Spring
Profiles](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/boot-features-profiles.html)
can be activated by configuring their `env` to include `SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE`
entries for your desired service. See the below [Custom Service
Settings](/reference/halyard/custom/#custom-service-settings) for more
information.

You can validate that your Custom Profiles have been picked up and applied to
their services by checking `~/.hal/$DEPLOYMENT/history/service-profiles.yml`.

### Custom Profile for Deck

To supply custom settings or new values that override generated settings for the
Deck UI, you can place them in a file called `settings-local.js`. For
example, to enable the `artifactsRewrite` feature flag, you can create the
following file:

__`~/.hal/default/profiles/settings-local.js`:__
```js
window.spinnakerSettings.feature.artifactsRewrite = true;
```

## Custom Service Settings

For each service, `$SERVICENAME`, you can supply a file
`~/.hal/$DEPLOYMENT/service-settings/$SERVICENAME.yml` to override any settings
as found in `~/.hal/$DEPLOYMENT/history/service-settings.yml`. For example, if
you wanted Echo to listen on port 443 with the `JAVA_OPTS="-Xms256m -Xmx512m"`
environment variables set, you create the following file:

__`~/.hal/default/service-settings/echo.yml`:__
```yaml
port: 443
env:
  JAVA_OPTS: "-Xms256m -Xmx512m"
```

If you wanted to specify a secure connection to redis, you would create the following file:

__`~/.hal/default/service-settings/redis.yml`:__
```yaml
overrideBaseUrl: redis://someuser:somepassword@localhost:6379
```

### Tweakable Service Settings

Below are all the Service Settings you can configure. Keep in mind the ones
generated by Halyard are generally best and are all that we test, so there is
no guarantee making changes to these will result in a working Spinnaker
cluster.

| Value | Description |
| ----- | ----------- |
| `address` | The address other services will use to lookup this service; e.g.  `localhost` or `redis.service.spinnaker.consul`. |
| `artifactId` | A fully-qualified identifier for the Artifact this service is to run - see your Service Settings output path for examples, since this varies by platform/deployment environment. |
| `basicAuthEnabled` | Whether or not to enable HTTP basic auth for this service. |
| `enabled` | Whether or not this service is enabled. Be careful, since disabling critical services like `consul-client` can make your entire installation unusable and un-upgradable. |
| `env` | Environment variables to make available to this Service. Supplied as YAML key-value pairs. |
| `healthEndpoint` | The HTTP endpoint that can be queried for health status.  Leave empty if you want Halyard to simply check that a TCP connection is openable. This information is typically transmitted to the platform's discovery system. |
| `host` | The host that this service will bind to. `0.0.0.0` will always work, but more restrictive bindings may be more secure. |
| `kubernetes` | You can add Kubernetes specific service settings, see details below. |
| `location` | The Spinnaker "location" this will be installed in. This is a namespace in Kubernetes, and a zone in GCE. |
| `monitored` | Whether or not this has monitoring endpoints exposed and understood by `spinnaker-monitoring`. |
| `overrideBaseUrl` | The baseURL this service is reachable on. This is already made configurable for Deck & Gate via `hal config security`, since these are both public-facing and may service from different hosts than they are discoverable on internal to Spinnaker. |
| `port` | The port number this service is bound to, and will accept requests on. |
| `safeToUpdate` | Whether or not this service can be shutdown, and spun on a new VM/container. This protects datastores like Vault & Redis from being taken down from Halyard. |
| `scheme` | The URI scheme for addressing this service, e.g. `http` vs.  `https`. |
| `skipLifeCycleManagement` | Whether or not Halyard should skip managing a service's life cycle. |
| `targetSize` | The initial number of nodes this service will be created with.  This is only respected on the initial deployment, and further edits will be rejected in favor of the prior service version's size. |


### Kubernetes

Inside the `kubernetes` item at the top level you can add a number of custom service settings that  impact how the Spinnaker services are deployed onto a Kubernetes cluster. This lets you partially configure how the Kubernetes `Deployment`, `Service`, `Pods` and other Kubernetes resources are deployed by Halyard. This allows you to do things like add a Kubernetes `secret` or `emptydir` to be mounted as a `Volume` and `VolumeMount`, change the default Kubernetes deployment strategy and more.

At a high level, the configurable items inside the Kubernetes service settings are:

| Item | Details |
| ----- | ----------- |
| `deploymentStrategy` | Defines either `RollingUpdate` or `Recreate` deployment strategy, including setting `MaxSurge` and `MaxUnavailable` See [Deployment Strategy](#deployment-strategy) below. |
| `imagePullSecrets` | Define secrets to use to pull a custom artifact when using an artifactId to swap out docker image. More details can be found in the [Image Pull Secrets section](#imagepullsecrets). |
| `nodePort` | When using a serviceType of NodePort, this provides the NodePort value. |
| `nodeSelector` | Provide a list of `nodeSelector` key-value pairs to add to the pod specification. See [Node Selector](#nodeselector) below. |
| `podAnnotations` | Provide a list of annotations to put on the deployed pods. See [Annotations and Labels](#podannotations-podlabels-and-servicelabels) below. |
| `podLabels` |  Provide a list of labels to put on the deployed pods. See [Annotations and Labels](#podannotations-podlabels-and-servicelabels) below. |
| `securityContext` | Set the securityContext that the Spinnaker services should run using in Kubernetes |
| `serviceLabels` | Provide a list of labels to put on the deployed services. See [Annotations and Labels](#podannotations-podlabels-and-servicelabels) below. |
| `serviceAccountName` | Provide a default `serviceAccount` under which to run Spinnaker services. |
| `serviceType` | Define a specific serviceType for deployed services, `ClusterIP` (Default) or `NodePort` |
| `useExecHealthCheck` | Disable the exec-based healthcheck if necessary. See [useExecHealthCheck](#useexechealthcheck) for details. |
| `volumes` | Define a set of `Volume` and `VolumeMount` items to be attached to the Pods through the Deployment. See [Custom Volumes](#using-custom-volumes) |


### imagePullSecrets

If making use of custom artifactIds from an authenticated docker registry imagePullSecrets must be made available in the replicaset definition. To specify imagePullSecrets to custom artifactIds they can be specified as follows:

```
kubernetes:
  imagePullSecrets:
  - desired-image-pull-secret1
  - desired-image-pull-secret2
```

### podAnnotations, podLabels and serviceLabels

Annotations and labels hold metadata that can be used to specify special behavior within Kubernetes. To apply annotations or labels to the `Pod` and `Service` resources for a particular Spinnaker service you can use something like:

```
kubernetes:
  podAnnotations:
    example/annotation: spinnaker.io
    example/annotation-2: halyard
  podLabels:
    examplePodLabel: examplePodLabelValue
  serviceLabels:
    exampleServiceLabel: exampleServiceLabelValue
```

These are all optional ways to control what metadata elements exist on the resources deployed by Halyard. For additional information about how these can be used, you can look at the [Annotations](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/annotations/) or [Labels and Selectors](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/labels/) pages from Kubernetes.

### nodeSelector

Node selector annotations will put out `nodeSelector` values in the Pod specification. They generally follow a similar syntax to the annotations and labels. For example:

```
kubernetes:
  nodeSelector:
     exampleNodeKey: exampleNodeValue
```

Additional information regarding Node Selectors can be found in [the Kubernetes NodeSelector documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/assign-pod-node/#nodeselector).

### useExecHealthCheck

By default halyard deploys services with an `exec`-based health check in order to improve compatibility with Istio. This however can break functionality for implementations of Load Balancer service types and Ingress Controllers that rely on having an http health check to validate. Setting `kubernetes.useExecHealthCheck: false` will switch the check method to be http based for such use cases.


### Using Custom Volumes

You can define a set of custom volumes for a particular service that will become `Volume` and `VolumeMount` items in the generated pod specifications when Halyard deploys Spinnaker on Kubernetes. This can be useful if you need to add custom CA Certificates or other files to Spinnaker service consistently.

The Kubernetes service settings allow you to mount volumes of type `configMap`, `secret` and `emptyDir` with the below syntax.

```
kubernetes:
  volumes:
  - id: secret-example-vol
    type: secret
    mountPath: /path/to/location/of/secret
  - id: configmap-example-vol
    type: configMap
    mountPath: /path/to/location/of/configMap
  - id: emptydir-example-vol
    type: emptyDir
    mountPath: /path/to/location/of/emptyDir
```
Make sure that the `id` field matches the `name` of the existing `secret` or `configmap` resource in Kubernetes that you need mounted.

### Deployment Strategy

You can change the deployment strategy that Kubernetes uses when deploying Spinnaker services.
For example, if you wanted to adjust the `maxSurge` and `maxUnavailable` percentages for a rolling update of Clouddriver, you would define a `clouddriver.yml` file in your Halyard `service-settings` like the one below.

```
kubernetes:
  deploymentStrategy:
    type: rollingUpdate
    strategySettings:
      maxSurge: 100%
      maxUnavailable: 50%
```

If you wanted to use a `Recreate` strategy instead, you would use:

```
kubernetes:
  deploymentStrategy:
    type: recreate
```

For additional information regarding the implication of each of these deployment strategies, consult the [Updating a Deployment](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/labels/) documentation.
