This article describes the currently-supported stages that you can add to your
Spinnaker pipelines.

Note that when you're creating a pipeline, you probably won't see every stage
that's listed here: you'll only see the stages that Spinnaker supports on your
provider.

## General

### Bake
Bake an image from the specified packages. Baking here refers to the process
of creating a machine image. Spinnaker's bakery is backed by
[Hashicorp's Packer](https://www.packer.io/intro/). Spinnaker provides default
[Packer templates](https://www.packer.io/docs/templates/index.html) and base
machine images in order to get you started, but see the
[bakery configuration guide](/setup/bakery/) if you want to customize your bake
process.

Note that Spinnaker skips the bake process if it detects that a new bake is
unnecessary. Spinnaker generates a unique key for each bake based on the bake
stage parameters: base OS, versioned packages, etc. If either the packages or
the bake stage parameters have changed, Spinnaker triggers a new bake. To change
the default behavior and re-bake your image each time the pipeline runs, select
**Rebake** in the **Bake Configuration** section.

### Canary Analysis
Use [Kayenta](/reference/architecture/#spinnaker-microservices) to run
[automated canary analysis](/guides/user/canary/) against the deployment
before fully deploying. Note that this stage _only_ handles analysis; you're
responsible for provisioning and cleaning up your canary instances. This is
typically done within the same pipeline via stages surrounding the
Canary Analysis stage.

For a step-by-step explanation of how to set up a Canary Analysis stage see the
[how-to guide](/guides/user/canary/stage/).

### Check Preconditions
Check for preconditions before continuing. For example, you can check that
your cluster is a particular size, or add a pipeline expression. See the
[pipeline expressions guide](/guides/user/pipeline-expressions/) for more
information about creating and using pipeline expressions.

### Clone Server Group
Copies all attributes of the original Server Group into a new Server Group (the
image that was deployed to it, its capacity, etc). You can choose to override
any of the properties of the original Server Group when creating the new one.

### Deploy
Deploy the previously baked or found image using the specified deployment
strategy. Spinnaker provides built-in support for both red/black (also known as
blue/green) and Highlander deployment strategies. You can also choose to deploy
with no impact on existing Server Groups, or build your own custom deployment
strategy.

### Destroy Server Group
Delete a Server Group and its resources from the specified Cluster. You must
specify whether you want to delete the newest, oldest, or previous
(second-most-recently deployed) Server Group when this stage starts.

### Disable Cluster
Disable the specified Cluster, which means that the cluster remains up but
stops handling traffic. If desired, you can leave a specific number of Server
Groups running while the rest of the cluster is disabled.

### Disable Server Group
The specified Server Group remains up but stops handling any traffic.
Any auto-scaling policies related to this Server Group will also be disabled.
Disabling Server Groups makes it easy to both route traffic to a new Server
Group and roll back those changes if necessary. You must choose whether to
disable the Server Group which is newest, oldest, or previous
(second-most-recently deployed) when this stage starts.

### Enable Server Group
Tell Spinnaker to resume sending traffic to the Server Group. The configuration
of your Load Balancer determines how traffic is routed among newly-enabled
Server Groups and any existing Server Groups. Enabling a Server Group also
re-enables auto-scaling policies, if applicable.

### Find Artifact From Execution
Find and bind an artifact from another pipeline execution.

### Find Image From Cluster
Find an image to deploy from an existing Cluster. Make sure that you specify the
Cluster and Server Group such that there is exactly one match, or this may
behave in unexpected ways.

### Find Image From Tags
Find an image to deploy from tags.

### Jenkins
Run the specified job in Jenkins. You must [set up Jenkins](/setup/ci/jenkins/)
in order to use this stage. Once Jenkins is configured, your Jenkins master and
available jobs are automatically populated in the respective drop-down menus.

### Manual Judgment
Wait for the user to click **Continue** before continuing. You can specify
instructions for how to decide whether to continue, or add input options
that users can choose from. These input options can be used to determine
pipeline behavior in downstream stages. For example, you can use the [**Check
Preconditions**](#check-preconditions) stage to ensure that a given stage only
runs if a particular input is specified.

### Pipeline
Run an existing pipeline: you can select any pipeline from this application and
run it as a sub-pipeline.

### Resize Server Group
Resize the oldest, newest, or second newest Server Group. You can resize the
Server Group by either a percentage of its current size or a specific amount.
The available resizing strategies are:
* **Scale Up**, which increases the size of the target Server Group.
* **Scale Down**, which decreases the size of the target Server Group.
* **Scale to Cluster Size**, which increases the size of the target Server Group
to match the largest Server Group in the Cluster. Optionally, you can specify
additional capacity to add as well.
* **Scale to Exact Size**, which adjusts the size of the target Server Group to
match the specified capacity.

### Rollback Cluster
Roll back one or more regions in a Cluster.

### Run Job
Run a container.

### Scale Down Cluster
Scale down a cluster. You can prevent this stage from scaling down active Server
Groups, or choose to keep a certain number of Server Groups at their current
size while the rest are scaled down.

### Script
Run a script.

### Shrink Cluster
Shrink a given cluster to contain nothing except a specified number of either
the newest or the largest Server Groups. You can choose whether to delete active
Server Groups if they donâ€™t fit the specified criteria.

### Tag Image
Tag an image.

### Wait
Wait a specified period of time.

### Webhook
Run a Webhook job.

### Wercker
Run the specified Wercker pipeline. You must [set up Wercker](/setup/ci/wercker/)
in order to use this stage. Once Wercker has been configured, your Wercker masters 
and the applications and pipelines available for your master's credentials will be shown 
in the drop-down menus.
When a Wercker pipeline stage runs, a link to the Wercker run will be available, and the status of
the Wercker run will be reported in Spinnaker.

## AppEngine

### Start AppEngine Server Group
Start a Server Group.

### Stop AppEngine Server Group
Stop a Server Group.

### Upsert AppEngine Load Balancers
Edit a Load Balancer.

## AWS

### Modify AWS Scaling Process
Suspend/resume scaling processes.

## Kubernetes

### Bake (Manifest)
Bake a manifest (or multi-doc manifest set) using a template renderer such as
Helm.

### Delete (Manifest)
Destroy a Kubernetes object created from a manifest.

### Deploy (Manifest)
Deploy a Kubernetes manifest YAML/JSON file.

### Find Artifacts From Resource
Find artifacts from a Kubernetes resource.

### Patch (Manifest)
Update an already existing Kubernetes resource in place using the [Kubernetes
patch operation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/run-application/update-api-object-kubectl-patch/).
Spinnaker can update the resource without knowing the entire resource (that is,
you have to specify only the portion of the manifest you want to update).

The patch stage can be used to add a label or update a sidecar container image
for a set of resources. It can also be used to implement a [rainbow deployment
](http://brandon.dimcheff.com/2018/02/rainbow-deploys-with-kubernetes/)
strategy for Kubernetes by first deploying a new ReplicaSet and then patching
the fronting service's selectors to point to the new ReplicaSet.

Spinnaker also supports [artifact substitution
](/reference/artifacts/in-kubernetes-v2/#binding-artifacts-in-manifests) for the
patch content just like the resource manifest in the deploy stage.

### Scale (Manifest)
Scale a Kubernetes object created from a manifest.

### Undo Rollout (Manifest)
Rollback a manifest a target number of revisions.
