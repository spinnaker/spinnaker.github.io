## Server Groups

A Server Group is a group of compute resource instances (VMs, container pods). The instances of a Server Group are identical and are managed as a group by the cloud platforms (e.g. ASGs, Kubernetes Replica Sets).

Server Groups mandatorily take on the naming convention *application-stack-detail-version*, where *stack* and *detail* are optional and *version* is system-assigned (incrementing version number). Spinnaker has no particular opinion on how the *stack* and *detail* fields are used, however it's common to use *stack* to represent a particular environment for a given microservice (e.g. dev, test, prod) and to use *detail* as an additional descriptor (e.g. feature branch, "experimental"). Finally, *version* indicates the specific Server Group, and individual instances of a Server Group are given a hash suffix in their names (e.g. "c9nzt") to uniquely identify each.

## Clusters

Clusters are logical groupings of Server Groups, by *application-stack-detail*. Clusters are used in situations where multiple Server Groups for a given microservice need to be coordinated in a single context, for example, during a red/black deployment.

## Applications

Applications are a logical grouping of infrastructure components - Server Groups and Clusters, Load Balancers, Security Groups and Pipelines. All components under a given Application share infrastructure credentials and top-level permissions. There are a few areas where cross-Application activities occur (e.g. a Stage that starts a Pipeline in another application), however in most areas, references are relegated to within the Application.

An Application typically corresponds to a particular microservice.

## Projects

Projects are arbitrary collections of infrastructure resources and pipelines. This is a convenience feature which allows you to create a dashboard containing Applications, Clusters and Pipelines by wildcard.

<!-- ## Infrastructure

This is a catch net area from which potentially lists all infrastructure components across all of Spinnaker that you have access to. You can search for Applications, Clusters, Server Groups, Instances, Load Balancers and Security Groups by wildcard. -->

## Load Balancers

Load Balancers route incoming traffic to associated and enabled Server Groups.

## Security Groups

Security Groups define traffic ingress rules for Server Groups.
