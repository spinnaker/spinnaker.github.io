In Spinnaker, a __Cloud Provider__ is an interface to a set of virtual
resources that Spinnaker has control over. Typically, this is a IaaS provider,
like [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/), or [GCP](https://cloud.google.com), but it
can also be a PaaS, like [App Engine](https://cloud.google.com/appengine),
or a container orchestrator, like [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io).

The cloud provider is central to everything you do in Spinnaker. It's
where you deploy your [Server Groups](/concepts/#server-group), the source of
your deployable artifacts, and the subject of automation via
[Pipelines](/concepts/pipelines).

## Accounts

In Spinnaker, an __Account__ is a named credential Spinnaker uses to
authenticate against a cloud provider. Each provider has slightly different
requirements for what format credentials can be in, and what permissions they
need to have afforded to them. The links under [Supported
Providers](#supported-providers) describe exactly how to create an
account and register the credentials with Halyard.

Keep in mind that every Provider can have as many accounts added as desired -
this will allow you to keep your environments (e.g. _staging_ vs. _prod_)
separate, as well as restrict access to sets of resources using Spinnaker's
[Authorization](/setup/security/authorization) mechanisms.
