# THIS REPOSITORY IS NO LONGER USED TO GENERATE THE SPINNAKER.IO WEBSITE.
All pull requests should be made in the new [github.com/spinnaker/spinnaker.io](https://github.com/spinnaker/spinnaker.io) repo.

## Local preview
The easiest way to preview and test your changes to Spinnaker.io is to run your branch locally with Docker, via the [dockerfile](https://github.com/spinnaker/spinnaker.github.io/blob/master/Dockerfile) included in the root directory.

In the root directory of your fork, run:
```sh
docker build --tag spinnaker/spinnaker.github.io-test .
docker run -it --rm --mount "type=bind,source=$(pwd),target=/code" \
    -p 4000:4000 spinnaker/spinnaker.github.io-test --incremental
```
Navigate to [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000) to see your locally generated page.

## Jekyll method
Alternatively, set up Jekyll and use it to run the site locally. It runs on Ruby, and running multiple versions of Ruby on a single system can create challenges. These instructions install [`rbenv`](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv), which makes it easy to install and switch to a specific Ruby version.

### Installation
1. (Optional) Create and run from a fresh VM instance, and forward the Jekyll default port (4000):
    1. `gcloud compute instances create jekyll --image-project=ubuntu-os-cloud --image-family=ubuntu-1804-lts --machine-type=n1-standard-1`
    1. `gcloud compute ssh jekyll --ssh-flag="-L 4000:localhost:4000"`
1. Install `rbenv` and `ruby-build`. Add these to `$PATH`:
    ```
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt-get install -y git bzip2 build-essential libssl-dev libreadline-dev zlib1g-dev
    git clone https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv.git ~/.rbenv
    git clone https://github.com/rbenv/ruby-build.git ~/.rbenv/plugins/ruby-build
    echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.rbenv/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc
    echo 'eval "$(rbenv init -)"' >> ~/.bashrc
    source ~/.bashrc
    ```
1. Install and use ruby 2.4.1
    ```
    rbenv install 2.4.1
    rbenv global 2.4.1
    ```
1. Fork and clone your forked repo:
    ```
    GITHUB_USER=$USER # or something else here
    git clone https://github.com/$GITHUB_USER/spinnaker.github.io.git
    ```
1. Install `bundle` gem
    ```
    cd spinnaker.github.io
    gem install bundler
    bundle install
    ```
Your system is now ready for local preview of the documentation site.

### Local preview
1. Start Jekyll server
    1. `bundle exec jekyll serve --watch`
1. (Optional): Add `--incremental` to speed up page generation when working on one page
    1. `bundle exec jekyll serve --watch --incremental`
1. Navigate to [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000) to see your locally generated page.


### (Optional) Host the website on Amazon S3

Hosting the documentation website on Amazon S3 allows review from look/feel perspective before a pull request is submitted.
This allows peer reviews of a breaking change without needing any technical setup by the reviewer.

1. [Enable static website hosting on a S3 Bucket](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/user-guide/static-website-hosting.html)
1. `gem install s3_website`
1. `s3_website cfg create`
1. Delete `s3_id` and `s3_secret` so that your AWS credentials can be read from `~/.aws/credentials`
1. Modify url property at _config.yml to use the CNAME that you want to use
1. `jekyll build`
1. `s3_website push`

## Page Generation

A page named `foo.md` will be transformed to `foo/index.html` and links to `foo` will result in an HTTP 301
to `foo/`. This has two implications:

1. It is more efficient to include the trailing `/` in links.
2. If you anticipate including resources like images or subpages, create `foo/index.md` instead of `foo.md`.

> During local development, see what's actually generated by browsing the `_site` directory.

## Mermaid

Sequence diagrams can be generated with the [mermaid.js](https://github.com/knsv/mermaid) library by adding `{%
include mermaid %}` near the bottom of the page. See some of the
[security docs](https://github.com/spinnaker/spinnaker.github.io/blob/master/setup/security/authentication/index.md)
for an example.

## Breadcrumbs

Each page has a breadcrumb trail at the top that is based on the URL structure. You should ensure that there is at
least an `index.md` file within each URL directory, otherwise the links will break.

## Link Checker
Keep the "broken window theory" at bay by ensuring all links work with
[HTML Proofer](https://github.com/gjtorikian/html-proofer)

Run link checker before committing:
`rake test`
