## Laying the groundwork for Spinnaker success
> This month's issue focuses on ways that cloud providers, project governors, contributors, and operators have laid groundwork to make 2020 Spinnaker's best year ever. With telemetry, a plugin framework, a hackathon, and new ways to install, manage, and integrate with Spinnaker, we're ready to share the most mature and capable continuous delivery platform with **literally everyone**.

## [Monitoring Spinnaker: SLA Metrics ("Is Spinnaker healthy?")](https://blog.spinnaker.io/monitoring-spinnaker-sla-metrics-a408754f6b7b)

With this overview of key metrics that indicate Spinnaker health across its services, Rob Zienert shares Netflix best practices. This guide helps operators sort noise out from service-specific metrics and meaningful request/response info emitted by Spinnaker’s RPC-linked components. Rob also proposes a new project contribution, of useful metrics documentation.


## [Enable Spinnaker Usage Statistics Today!](https://www.spinnaker.io/community/stats/)

In 2020, the vision of data-driven product development for Spinnaker has taken a big step forward with the implementation of Telemetry. For release 1.18.x, telemetry is opt-in, for testing and fine-tuning. You can help provide a clear picture by turning data collection on in your Spinnaker instance(s) now. As of 1.19.0+, telemetry will be enabled by default. See the linked community stats page for instructions and more info.


## [Plugin Creators Guide](https://www.spinnaker.io/guides/user/plugin-users/)

Armory and Netflix engineers have built a plug-in framework that helps you extend Spinnaker without having to add custom stages. The new plugin system allows us to integrate services with Spinnaker outside of runtime, with clearly defined extension points to work from. The new [Plugin Creators Guide](/guides/developer/plugin-creators/) walks us through creating and loading a simple plugin. Use it as a starting point to build your own!
