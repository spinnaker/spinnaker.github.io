## Open Source: #BetterTogether
> This month's issue focuses Spinnaker's strong open source DNA. Spinnaker builds a bridge between the collaboration story at the core of Linux culture and the powerful cloud economy that has leveraged it to transform software delivery. OSS community efforts to build native Kubernetes|Spinnaker integration highlight this unique strength.

## [How to Build a Centos RPM Via a Spinnaker "Bake"](https://blog.opsmx.com/how-to-build-bake-centos-rpm-using-spinnaker/)
Spinnaker doesn't offer a CentOS baking option by default. In this tech blog, learn to use package management and S3 to bake a build as a CentOS image. Then, deploy an instance of the baked image on AWS cloud. With the RPM built, configuring and executing the bake in Spinnaker requires just a few steps.

## ['Just Me and Opensource' Tutorials Available on Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9EUyMjR6jSc&t=2s)
Fans of the __[Just me and Opensource](https://www.youtube.com/user/wenkatn)__ online tutorials got a nice dose of CD when the popular <span class="x x-first x-last">YouTuber</span> published a new segment of his Kubernetes series focused on deploying Spinnaker to Kubernetes. Brilliant to learn hands-on how these open<span class="x x-first x-last">-</span>source software tools and technologies are better together.

## Getting Started with Spinnaker: Easier Than Ever
The community has worked hard to make getting up and running with an open source Spinnaker instance easier than ever. OpsMX has shared their [Easy Spinnaker](https://github.com/OpsMx/enterprise-spinnaker/tree/master/scripts/easy-spinnaker) method, which creates a single-node install in Kubernetes. Meanwhile, Armory has developed [Minnaker](https://github.com/armory/minnaker) for POC and evaluation installs of Spinnaker in a Linux VM using K3S.

## [Adobe Experience Platform Leverages Spinnaker](https://www.facebook.com/costi.muraru/posts/3088480564511758)
Adobe SREs Constantin Muraru and Dan Popescu presented the aptly named "Deploying your real-time apps on thousands of servers and still being able to breathe" at StrataData in London. They sought an open-source platform to pick up where Jenkins leaves off for more automated and reliable delivery. They chose Spinnaker because of its rich out-of-the-box integrations and deployment strategies.
